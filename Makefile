# Project root. This file holds the cross-cutting tasks (test, clean, install,
# ...) and INCLUDES one fragment per build area, each living in the folder it
# builds: mk/lib.mk (out/lib headers), host/build.mk (the POSIX CLI), crew/build.mk
# (the crew app scripts), port/inle/kernel.mk (the freestanding kernel), test/test.mk
# (the gates), mk/install.mk. wasm keeps its own Makefile. Device ports (playdate,
# rp2040) live in the separate l-ports repo. Build output lands under out/
# (out/host, out/free, out/lib, out/dl). Shared vars live in common.mk.

# love0 -- the bootstrap interpreter, PINNED to the canonical out/host tree (never
# $(hsuf)'d like $(ho)): it bakes the lcat headers every frontend shares. Defined
# UP HERE, not by the host-build block below, because test_love0's prerequisite uses
# it -- and make expands prerequisites at PARSE time, so a later definition reads as
# empty, silently dropping test_love0's dep on the binary. Serially that hides (the
# earlier test_host builds love0 transitively via host -> lib_h -> love0); under -j,
# test_love0 then races ahead of the love0 link ("out/host/love0: No such file").

# every ai run UNDER make boots deterministically: the test gate must exercise the freshly-built egg
# (not a stale baked image), and the bench controls glazed-vs-interp itself. So suppress the startup
# image auto-load for all recipes. The USER's binary (run outside make) still wakes its baked image.

# NB: there is NO git pre-commit hook -- committed artifacts (wasm/love.js, bench/
# bench.html) are rebuilt MANUALLY (`make wasm`, `make -C bench html`) and staged
# by hand. An auto-rebuild hook re-ran the benchmarks on every commit (minutes);
# it was removed deliberately. Rebuild before committing artifact-affecting code.

# crew/cook/Cookfile: this Makefile transpiled into a resolved cook recipe by
# `cook --emit` (crew/cook/cook.l). cook reads this Makefile directly too, but the

# RESOLVED -- a flat, self-documenting snapshot. Regenerate it whenever the
# Makefile changes. (A baked snapshot: re-run `make crew/cook/Cookfile` after adding
# a source/test file, since the wildcard lists are frozen at emit time.)
