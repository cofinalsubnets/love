# crew/build.mk -- the crew app builds (kore/mooncc/reef scripts + mooncc.image)
#
# Fragment of the root Makefile (split out 2026-07-15). Included by ./Makefile,
# which is invoked from the project root; paths resolve from there. Shared vars
# live in common.mk. Every recipe here is unchanged from the single-file Makefile.

# kore (crew/kore/): the myers + patience diff engines, the text/tool surface,
# the line tools (crew/kore/core.l: cat head tail wc sort uniq tee + the trivia),
# and `kore`, the multi-call toolbox (busybox's trick -- one binary, the util picked
# off the command line or an argv[0] symlink; crew/kore/kore.l is the dispatcher).
# The law file holds the engines to their projections, to an O(nm) LCS oracle
# (minimality), the u-floor to its GNU faces, and seeded fuzzes; the kore smokes then
# drive the BUILT artifact: diff + the line tools byte-identical to GNU (LC_ALL=C
# for sort), the exit triple, argv[0] dispatch through a `diff` symlink, usage at 2,
# and (x86_64) `kore as` assembling an exit(7) ELF that RUNS. Gate = the law sentinel
# AND exit 0 AND the smokes.

# mooncc: the C compiler is its OWN app, NOT baked into the kore cat -- a cc edit rebuilds
# only mooncc (never kore), so an kore rebuild in another session can't tear the compiler.
# Its own cat: the u-floor (text+core), a FRESH holo module
# with ALL backends (holo.l opens the scope layer, seal.l closes it as `holo` -- so mooncc
# cross-compiles every target regardless of what the host image baked), the asbook re-leak,
# elf/obj/link writers, then crew/moon/{lex,cpp,parse,gen,cc}.l whose tail SEAT fires.
# (crew/holo/text.l = the neutral-text assembler front end gen.l's inline asm
# parses templates with; it leaks stream globals incl. a `parse` rebind -- fine
# here, no later cat member reads them bare.)

#
# the build-tree kore/mooncc bins are WAKE SHIMS over their sibling images -- the
# exact shape mk/install.mk installs: `#!/bin/sh` resolving its own directory, then
# exec'ing the SIBLING ai on the SIBLING image. the interpreter is never PATH's, so
# a tree-fresh cat can never run under a foreign (older-baked) binary -- the skew
# that once laid EMPTY .text when obj.l read a `holo` book key an installed ai's
# bake lacked. the image is anchor-checked to that binary, and make keeps cat,
# image and shim fresh together: consistency is structural, not checked at runtime.
# (bonus: every cold invocation -- the m4/tar builds pay dozens -- wakes in ~ms
# instead of re-evaling the cat ~1.3s.) kore's shim threads basename($0) through as
# the program name, so the argv[0]-symlink dispatch (`diff` -> kore) still lands.
