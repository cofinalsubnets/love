# cook.mk -- a make-shaped front door to cook (crew/cook/cook.l + crew/cook/Cookfile).
#
# `make` is muscle memory; cook is the build tool written in ai. This STUB
# bridges them: `make -f cook.mk <goal>` makes sure the ai binary exists, then
# hands the goal to cook, which reads Cookfile. The real Makefile is left untouched
# and stays the source of truth for the irreducible C bootstrap -- cook RUNS on
# ai, so it cannot build ai; that one rung is delegated to make, and cook
# ports everything above it (see Cookfile).
#
# usage:  make -f cook.mk            # the default goal (all = the host build)
#         make -f cook.mk test
#         make -f cook.mk clean
#
# anything cook can't drive -- qemu, a tty repl, the wasm/kernel sub-makes, perf
# (cook's `run` captures stdout and waits, so no streaming and no tty) -- is passed
# straight to the real Makefile below.

# no-ops when current), so this is not a staleness gate, just an existence one.
