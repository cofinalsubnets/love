 * from its 16th digit, %.20f of 0.1 answered twenty zeros where the value
 * carries ...00555, and a TIE could not be broken at all -- the residue that
 * decides it had already been rounded away, so %.0f of 2.5 said 3 where every
 * conforming printf says 2. an approximate converter cannot be gated against
 * an exact one; that is the whole reason this is a bignum and not a patch.
