# moon-parity.sh -- one C feature per row, every mooncc target per column: which
# lanes exist where. doc/misc/moon-c-gaps.md's parity table is this script's output,
# and `moon-parity.sh check` holds the doc to it.
#
# moon-sweep.sh measures one target against a real package; moon-reject.sh measures
# the refusal surface against gcc. This measures the TARGETS AGAINST EACH OTHER,
# which neither of those can see: a lane that x64 has and rv64 does not is
# invisible to any single-target sweep, and invisible to gcc, because gcc has them
# all. Cross-target drift is the failure this tree actually ships -- src/core/love.c compiles
# everywhere, so the gaps live in the C that src/core/love.c never writes.
#
# THREE VERDICTS per cell, and the third is the interesting one:
#   ok       -- an object came out, referencing nothing the probe did not declare.
#               The lane is ours.
#   libgcc   -- an object came out, and it CALLS OUT: a lane that exists but is
#               borrowed. On a freestanding seat that is a link-time dependency,
#               not a compile-time one, so only the object's symbols reveal it.
#   —        -- refused. The cause is printed by `moon-parity.sh why`.
#
# The borrow test is "an undefined symbol the probe's own source never declared",
# not a grep for __aeabi_ -- so it catches an x64 or rv64 lane reaching for
# libgcc's own spellings (__divti3, __muldc3) as readily as arm's.
#
# ⚠ NO FOREIGN TOOL: the symbols come from `kore nm -u`, which is holo's ELF reader
# (src/core/holo/link.l's ld-syms) behind nm's surface -- one wake over every object the
# sweep laid, not one readelf per cell. Everything this script needs, the tree built.
#
# ⚠ A cell is a COMPILE, not a run. `ok` means the lane exists, never that it is
# right -- test_cts and the cross gates are what say that. Read this table for the
# SHAPE of the coverage and go elsewhere for its depth.
#
# ⚠ thumb2 and thumb2sp get their own columns, and the reason is one row: thumb2sp
# is ARMv7E-M with an SP-only FPU (the Playdate's STM32F746), so f64 softens to
# __aeabi_* where thumb2's fpv5-d16 does it in hardware. A merged t32 column hides
# exactly that, which is how the hand-written table got it wrong.
