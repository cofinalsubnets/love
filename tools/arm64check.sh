# arm64check.sh -- the aarch64 EXECUTION validator. Cross-builds `love` for aarch64
# (reusing the native love0-generated headers in out/lib) and RUNS a test corpus
# under qemu-aarch64. apps/asm/asmtest.l proves the arm64 byte ENCODINGS; this proves
# they RUN -- the only trustworthy check for the glaze's second target, since the
# glaze self-test executes the machine code it emits.
#
# Needs qemu-aarch64 (qemu-user) + an aarch64 cross-gcc with a static libc. Point
# AARCH64_CC at it, or let the auto-find try the usual names + the local Nerves
# toolchain. No-ops (exit 0, a note) when either is missing -- like test_kernel /
# test_wasm. love does its own write(2)-based I/O, so it is unaffected by the
# static-glibc printf-vararg quirk seen under qemu.
#
# Args: $1.. = the .l files to run (default: the corpus). The gate is the
# "tests pass" sentinel AND a clean exit (a reader-stop exits 0 without it).
