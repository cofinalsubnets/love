# moon-gzip.sh -- build gzip 1.2.4 with mooncc + nolibc + the holo linker (no
# gcc/glibc/ld) and prove it RUNS: round-trips over four shapes of input, `-t`
# integrity, the `-l` listing, and -- the one that matters -- FORMAT ACCURACY
# both ways against the system gzip. The second moon-userland rung
#, after bzip2.
#
# 1.2.4 is the pre-gnulib gzip: 14 plain C89/K&R files, no gnulib link tree and
# no C23 header cascade, which is why it is the version that reaches a RUNNABLE
# binary. (1.13 compiles its 8 core files but its far end is ~100 gnulib TUs.)
#
# Point GZIPSRC at a CONFIGURED gzip-1.2.4 tree (its configure writes the
# Makefile this reads DEFS from -- we pass the same three by hand). Without one
# the check SKIPS. To make one:
#   curl -O https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gzip/gzip-1.2.4.tar.gz
#   tar xzf gzip-1.2.4.tar.gz && cd gzip-1.2.4 && CC="gcc -std=gnu89" ./configure
#   make moon-gzip GZIPSRC=$PWD/gzip-1.2.4
# and the sources are CACHED, so a bare `make moon-gzip` finds `gzip-1.2.4*`
# under dl/ then under $MOONSRC (~/src when unset). An explicit GZIPSRC= still
# outranks both, and a missing tree is a clean SKIP rather than a failure.
#
# ⚠ configure is not load-bearing here: DEFS is three macros this script passes
# anyway, so an UNconfigured tree builds too. It stays the witness because it is
# the one file that says the tree was prepared.
#
# THREE TARGETS, one procedure (raw.sh's shape): `moon-gzip.sh a64` cross
# compiles and runs under qemu, SKIPPING cleanly without it.
#
# ⚠ THE ONE APP-SIDE EDIT, and it is a real 64-bit portability bug in gzip, not
# a mooncc gap: gzip.c calls `ctime` with no declaration in scope. On the 32-bit
# machines of 1993 the implicit `int` return was the same width as the pointer;
# on x86-64 it TRUNCATES the returned char*. We prepend `#include <time.h>` to a
# COPY, leaving the imported tree pristine.
