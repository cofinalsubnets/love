(* proof/spec.v -- ai's headline laws, machine-checked in Rocq.

   The executable spec is test/spec.l: every claim assert-backed, on every
   target, green under `make test`. That DEMONSTRATES the laws (it exhibits
   them at runtime). This file is the translation "back to coq" that upgrades
   demonstrate toward PROVE -- the same laws as theorems in a consistent
   metatheory.

   Scope: the pure combinator / numeral / absence core -- spec.l's first
   section ("everything is a function"). The numeric tower (float, complex,
   bignum) and the honest transcendental misses (e^(i*pi) misses -1 by ~1e-16
   ON PURPOSE) are deliberately out of this first slice.

   "up to explosion of world": the uu kernel (test/uu.l) runs type-in-type
   (UniMath's `Unset Universe Checking`), so there `empty` is inhabited
   -- `but_seriously_the_world_explodes : empty` (uu.l:1355) -- and ex falso
   gives every value. This file lives in UNIVERSE-CHECKED Rocq: the world does
   not explode here, so the theorems below are unconditional. The caveat is
   honest about the only escape hatch any formal demonstration has -- the
   consistency of its own metatheory.

(* order & equality: < is a TOTAL order over all values         *)
(* ============================================================ *)

(* The total order flattens the type lattice into BANDS, low to high (TRUE-BLUE:
   the symbol band -- mints AND noms -- is the floor, below string and number):
     symbol < string < number < product < map < top
   and orders within each band by value / lexicographically. This slice
   models the band structure with one comparable key per band (the within-band
   lex order for text and products collapsed to that key -- the lexicographic
   refinement is the next slice). The point proved here is the marquee claim:
   the relation is a genuine TOTAL ORDER (irreflexive + transitive + trichotomy
   for <, reflexive + antisymmetric + transitive + total for <=), and `=` is
   its Eq cell -- propositional equality, a linear order not a preorder.

   `=` bridges the numeric tower (3 = 3.0): a number band carries the
   mathematical value rep-blindly, so the float 3.0 and the fixnum 3 are the
   SAME Onum -- there is no separate rep to model. And `idp` (pointer identity)
   is FINER than `=` on heap values: '(1) = '(1) yet !(idp '(1) '(1)). Identity
   has no model here, where nothing is shared -- a deliberate omission. *)

(* ============================================================ *)

(* `=` on functions is alpha-equivalence of their source. With de Bruijn
   indices alpha-equivalence IS syntactic equality (the names are gone), so it
   is DECIDABLE and structural -- exactly the spec's claim. A number NEVER
   equals a closure: numerals ACT as their lambdas under apply ((1 z) = z,
   (0 z) = 1 -- the reduction section below), but `=` stays representation-
   strict (bridging 0/1 would break congruence (2 * id <> 2), the total
   order (a lambda seats in the top band), and tower transitivity).

   Where the line sits, precisely (it is NOT "never reduce"): `=` cannot chase
   GENERAL beta -- beta-equality of lambda terms is undecidable (a common reduct
   may never appear), and `=` is total -- so on two SOURCE terms it stays α+structural
   and reduces nothing. eta likewise stays unbridged: (\ x (f x)) /= f (eta_not_bridged
   below), since bridging it means REDUCING an unreduced term, off the decidable side.
   BUT a CLOSURE VALUE is `ev`'s already-reduced artifact -- a partial-app is a held
   beta-redex with its argument captured RIGHT THERE -- so closure `=` (and the α-hash a
   map keys by) sees the ONE reduction `ev` performed to build it: (adder 5) = (\ x (+ x 5)).
   That is decidable (the redex is already contracted in the value -- finite captures, no
   search) and adds no reduction power: it is exactly st_beta surfaced into `=`
   (closure_beta_bridge, in the reduction section). So `=` never reduces on its OWN; it
   just declines to pretend the capture isn't there. *)

   assertion against the real binary in test/spec.l (e.g. ((\ x x) 5) ; 5): the

(* + and * are generic: the sequence monoid and repetition      *)
(* ============================================================ *)

(* `+` on sequences (strings, lists) is concatenation -- a MONOID: associative,
   with the empty sequence as identity ("" and () are the units, cat_nil_l/r).
   The runtime LIFTS that unit out of the sequence lane: a bare mint -- the zero
   point () too -- is the UNIT, the do-nothing element, the IDENTITY of BOTH + and
   * in EVERY lane (() + x = () * x = x for a number, string, complex, array,
   anything), not just on sequences. 0 and 1 are its two FACES: the unit shows 0
   (the additive identity) in + and 1 (the multiplicative identity) in *, one
   nothing reading as each operation's identity -- yet it stays the unit, NOT the
   number 0 (which annihilates *: smul 0 = []). The model is typed-by-sequences,
   so cat_nil_l/r (the + unit) and smul_one (the * unit) are the witnessed
   fragments; the scalar lanes are that same unit extended by dispatch. `*` is
   REPEATED `+`: a sequence times a count is that many copies concatenated, and
   the count SATURATES (max 0, ceil) -- a non-positive count gives the empty
   sequence. `+` is also the MEASURE HOMOMORPHISM: the net of a concatenation
   is the sum of the nets. The BYTE LAW (a string + an exact integer 0..255 is
   one byte; rep-blind, so 66 and 66.0 alike) is the one PARTIAL case, modeled
   as an option -- None is nil. The other failures are the same None lane:
   NAMED-symbol-`+` (named symbols left the string algebra) and string-`-`
   (numeric only) are nil, not modeled separately. *)

(* strings, symbols & mints                                     *)
(* ============================================================ *)

(* A string is its bytes (list Z): it INDEXES them, its NET is the charm sum (a
   NUL byte nets nothing, so + reaches the bytes and an all-NUL text is
   nothing), and tally COUNTS them. A symbol is a POINT: a mint is a fresh
   nameless point -- serial-keyed, materially empty ($ = 0), applying const-1,
   DISTINCT from every other and equal only to itself; the zero point is the
   mint at serial 0, the face of absence. A nom is the explicit PRODUCT
   (name . mint) -- a chain of a name string and a mint, EXACTLY as internally
   (cap the name, cup the mint), ordered (name lex, then the mint's serial);
   same-name noms split by serial. The symbol band (mints AND noms) is the
   FLOOR: it sorts BELOW string and number, so every point sits below every
   number -- (mint 0) < 0, the blue floor -- and a bare mint below a named nom
   (proved via the order section's `lt`: a point or nom is Osym, a string Ostr,
   a number Onum). *)
