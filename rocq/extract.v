(* extract.v -- the differential oracle's reference normalizer, EXTRACTED.

   test/oracle.l hand-transcribes spec.v's subst into ai; this closes that gap.
   Here the executable normalizer is built directly on spec.v's PROVEN `subst`
   and `shift` (Require Import spec), then extracted to OCaml. So the reference
   the fuzzer runs is, up to the standard nat->int extraction mapping, the very
   definitions the spec.v theorems are about -- machine-checked end to end.

   `nf` mirrors test/oracle.l's evaluator exactly: ai's strategy -- N-ary
   closures, CBV, weak (no reduction under a binder), saturating (a beta step
   fires only when all n args are present; an under-applied closure is held
   unreduced). The beta primitive it uses IS spec.v's st_beta (lemma below). *)

(* the machine-checked LINK: the beta step `nf` performs (via apply_n -> subst
   0 a b) is exactly spec.v's proven st_beta. So the executable reference's one
   reduction primitive is the relation the theorems reason about. (Full
   normalization soundness vs `step` is the Tier-1 confluence project; this is
   the local correspondence, axiom-free.) *)
