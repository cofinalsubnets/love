# the map's collision strategy — why open addressing stays

A note on a question that comes up whenever the `hash` bench lands behind node (0.76) / pypy
(0.44): love's map sits at ~1.07 ms/it — **would a different table structure close the gap?** We
prototyped the candidates as standalone C microbenchmarks (open addressing vs split arrays vs
cdr-coded chaining), measured them against the bench's exact access pattern, and the answer is
**no — open addressing is the right fit for love's load factor.** This records the designs, the
numbers, and the why, so we don't re-litigate it.

## what love does today

The map is **open-addressed, linear-probe**, with `(key, value)` slots **interleaved** in one
backing: `[lvm_map_data, len, cap, k0,v0, k1,v1, …]` (love.c, `map_slots`/`ai_mapput`). The hash is
multiplicative — `rotl(mapmix * tagkey, 32) & mask`, `mapmix = 0x9e3779b97f4a7c15` — and it grows
(doubling + rehash) at the **0.75 load factor**: `(len+1)*4 >= cap*3`. The glaze compiles the probe
to native (`mprobe-ir`/`mpeep`/`mpin`) for the scan/bump/insert loops. With `(tablet n)` presizing
the backing, the `hash` bench's 10000 sparse inserts never rehash (see the landed lane: tablet
size-hint + `minsert` + the plift presize rewrite, ~13%: 1.18 → ~1.03).

## the access pattern we measured

The `hash` bench, faithfully: into a presized table (cap 16384 for N=10000, ~61% load), **insert**
N keys `1+97*i` (sparse, so they actually hash), a **sum-scan**, a read-modify-write **bump**, a
second sum-scan. Same hash, same tagged keys (`2k+1`, odd; gap = even), pure C `-O2` so the numbers
are the **probe/cache cost** — what the native lane pays — not love's eval overhead.

## the candidates and the numbers

Read/update passes (scan+bump+scan) on a pre-built structure, ms/it, two machines-warm runs:

| design | ms/it | vs open addressing |
|---|---|---|
| **A — open addressing, interleaved (k,v)** *(today)* | 0.029 | baseline |
| **B — cdr-chaining, scattered** (insertion order, the write-burst reality) | 0.034 | **0.85×** (−15%) |
| **C — cdr-chaining, compacted** (per-bucket contiguous runs, post-GC ideal) | 0.072 | **0.38×** (−60%) |
| **split arrays** `keys[]` / `vals[]` (full workload, separate bench) | — | **0.94×** (−6%) |

Every alternative **loses**. Two distinct reasons:

- **split arrays** (probe a dense `keys[]`, value in a parallel `vals[]`): the denser key-probe
  doesn't help — at 61% load the chains are ~1–2 steps — and every hit now pays a **second cache
  line** to reach `vals[I]`. Value co-location wins. The bench does 3 lookup passes, so that second
  fetch lands 30000 times.

- **chaining** (cdr-coded or not): every lookup pays an **extra indirection** — hash → bucket-head
  array → entries — *before* it can touch data. Open addressing hashes **straight to the slot**.
  At short chains, that one head-pointer hop costs more than the clustering chaining avoids.
  Compacting the chains (cdr-coding: contiguous runs, no next-pointers) fixes *traversal* — but
  traversal is already ~1 step here, so it buys nothing while the indirection remains (and our C
  variant's two metadata arrays made it worse; even an ideal single-array head wouldn't beat A).

## the cdr-coding angle (it IS clean here — just not a win at this load)

cdr-coding's general blocker is **shared tails**: the copying GC can't lay two lists' shared tail
out contiguously without breaking the sharing. A hash table **owns the only pointers to its
chains** — no entry is reachable from two buckets — so the collector is free to cdr-code/compact
them. That observation is correct, and it's why C (compacted) is reliably *achievable* post-GC, not
just hypothetical: the moving collector walks the live set anyway, so compacting the chains is
~free, not an extra O(n) pass. **It's still not worth it**, because the win it unlocks (no
clustering, sequential per-bucket scan) only matters at **high load with long chains**, and love
caps load at 0.75 — chains never get long. The structural cost (bucket indirection, allocate-per-
insert vs in-place store) is paid at *every* load.

**Sorted chains** (keep each bucket ordered by the total order) are a further refinement on top of
chaining — early-exit on a MISS, or binary search in a compacted run. Same verdict, more so: the
payoff scales with chain length and only helps misses (the bench's scans are all hits), while
maintaining sorted order taxes the write path (insert into the middle of a compacted run, O(chain),
vs O(1) prepend). Worth it for a high-load, miss-heavy membership set — not for love's regime.

## where each WOULD win

Not academic — just not love's operating point:

- **chaining / cdr-compacted**: high load factor (≥0.9), where open addressing's clustering
  explodes and per-bucket isolation + sequential traversal pays off.
- **sorted chains**: the above + miss-heavy lookups (membership filters).
- **split arrays**: probe-heavy workloads that rarely read the value (e.g. `tally`/`keys`-style
  passes), or very long chains where touching skipped values wastes cache.

love runs none of these: 0.75 cap, value-co-located lookups, short chains.

## so where IS the gap to node/pypy?

**Not the collision strategy.** It's a different axis:

1. **JIT specialization** — pypy's tracing JIT specializes the *whole* int-keyed loop (inline hash,
   hoist, drop bounds checks); for small ints `hash(n)=n`. love's glaze compiles the loop but the
   probe stays a generic open-addressed scan.
2. **the compact/ordered dict** (CPython 3.6+ / V8) — a tiny **index array** (1–2 bytes/slot,
   cache-resident) into a **dense entries array**. The cache win is on the *index probe*, and the
   dense entries also give cheap **ordered iteration** (`keys`/`$`). That's a real structure win,
   but it's orthogonal to open-vs-chained, it complicates **delete** (tombstones + compact-on-
   resize vs love's clean backward-shift) and it can **regress the common small-map case** (the
   `book`, tablets) with its two-array indirection. A possible future, weighed on its own — but it
   wouldn't have shown up in *this* question (collision strategy), which is settled.

## reproduce

The microbenches are pure C (`gcc -O2`), three files: split (`maplayout.c`), open-vs-chained full
workload (`maplayout2.c`), and read-isolated (`maplayout3.c`). They model love's hash + tagged keys +
presized cap exactly; swap the layout, keep everything else fixed. Re-run before trusting any prior
here — the numbers are cache-microarchitecture-sensitive, but the *ordering* (A < B < C, split < A)
has been stable across runs.
