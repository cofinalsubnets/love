# NAME

lush - the love shell, a POSIX command shell 🐚

# SYNOPSIS

**lush** \[**--login**\] \[**-aceugx** \[*command* \[*name* \[*arg*...\]\]\] | *script* \[*arg*...\]\]

**kore** **sh** ... (or an **sh** symlink to kore)

# DESCRIPTION

**lush** is a POSIX-compatible command shell written in **love**(1). It is the project's daily-driver shell, the shell its build and gate scripts run under, and the console shell of the love distro (where `/bin/sh` is a kore symlink that lands here).

Interactively it offers an editable line with Tab completion (commands from PATH and the builtins at command position, pathnames after; `~` folds and unfolds), persistent history (*~/.lush_history*, appended on Enter), a prompt carrying the current directory, the last nonzero exit status, and the git branch when inside a repository, and real job control: `^Z` stops the foreground job, **jobs**/**fg**/**bg** manage it, a trailing `&` backgrounds a pipeline, `$!` names it. An error at the prompt re-prompts; the terminal is never left raw.

The script subset covers pipelines and lists (`| && || ; !`), redirects including io-numbers and `2>&1`, here-documents (`<<`, `<<-`), command substitution (`$( )` and backticks), globbing (`* ? [..]`, quoting-aware), tilde expansion, `if`/`while`/`until`/`for`/`case`, `{ }` groups and `( )` subshells, functions with `return`, shell variables over the environment (`export` promotes), positional parameters with the quoted-`"$@"` law, the `${x:-y}` parameter-expansion family including `${#x}` and `${x#pat}`/`${x%pat}`, `${(`*form*`)}` love interpolation (below), and `set -e -u -x`.

One expansion is not POSIX's: `${(` *FORM* `)}` is a love form, evaluated in the shell's own image and spliced into the word -- the love twin of `` ` ` ``, with no process, no pipe and no fork behind it. `echo ${(1 + 2)}` says `3`; `echo "the answer is ${(6 * 7)}"` says `42`; `n=${(sort [3 1 2])}` holds `(1 2 3)`. THE READER IS THE SCANNER: the extent comes from **love**(1)'s own `sound`, not from a shell walk, so the body obeys love's lexical law and not the shell's -- a `'` is a sigil, a `;` runs to the end of its line, and a `)` or `}` inside a `"…"` is text. A form the reader finds unfinished asks for a continuation line, the way an open quote does. The answer is ONE field: never split on `$IFS`, never globbed, quiet like `"${x}"` -- a love answer is a value, not a byte stream. A string answers its bytes and anything else prints in love notation, and a form that raises expands to nothing with a word on standard error. `${` with a non-POSIX operator was already an error, so no script that lexed before this means anything new.

Command substitution does not fork *for the substitution*. A body that only says its piece -- **pwd**, **:**, **true**, **false** -- is taken by a sink this task wears, with no pipe and no child at all. A body whose every stage is a plain external word is put straight onto the pipe, and its words then take the ladder below like any other command -- so `$(basename x)` costs the fork that a plain `basename x` does not, the one place the in-image lane is out of reach. Anything else runs in the shell itself with stdout on a pipe a cooperative task drains, so any size flows. POSIX puts the body in a subshell, and forkless there is nobody to copy the state, so lush puts back by hand what a fork would have taken: the working directory, shell variables, functions, positional parameters, `$0`, the `-e -u -x` flags, and the environment. What it does not put back: a job started inside stays the shell's, an fd opened inside stays open, and **umask** and the signal dispositions stand. `exit` inside a body ends the body with that status, as it would in a subshell.

Some commands do not fork either. When a word names a tool whose main rides this very image and the word is *ours*, lush calls it here instead of exec'ing it: no fork, no exec, no image wake, and the tool answers its exit status as a value (see **kore**(1) on the status charm). What makes a word ours is the mode. In **autonomous** mode, the default, a bare word that names a verb this binary carries is ours whatever PATH holds -- the tools act as builtins, and the few shapes that must spawn (below) spawn this binary under that name, so PATH decides nothing for them either. Under **-g**, gregarious, the test is PATH's and strict: `stat` through PATH's winner must match the running binary's own path (`selfpath`), so one artifact on PATH wearing many names takes the lane, while an *installed twin of our own name* -- same tool, different build -- spawns like anything else, and so does a name PATH resolves to somebody else's binary. A word with a `/` always spawns, in either mode. The verdict is taken once per word per session, and it is the simple foreground command only: a pipeline stage has to be a process, and takes the fork lane below instead.

The list of words that may take it is deliberately short. A main only qualifies if running it here is the *same thing* as running it there, and three kinds fail that -- a main that quits (it would end its caller), one holding state a single run owns (a recursive `$(MAKE)`), and one that can block (a spawned `cat` or `sleep` is a child `^C` kills and `kill %1` can name; in here neither is true). **mooncc**(1) is the one that pays most, since a build spends its life calling it; the rest are the bounded file and text tools a build spells between compiles. The tools that read standard input when handed no file operand stay off it and wait on the interrupt and stdin story -- nothing about the image wake waits with them, because the lane below already carries it.

A word that is ours but does not qualify takes the next-best door: lush forks, and does not exec. The child inherits the woken image, hands its whole command line to the same entry the exec would have reached, and quits with its status -- so a session, pipeline stages and all, pays one image wake between every command in it. The three disqualifiers above are a child's own business: its quit is an exit status, its state is a copy, and it blocks holding a pid that `^C` and `kill %1` can name. Three asks still spawn, because each is settled before a heap exists and a fork is the one thing that cannot redo them: `bake`, `wake`, and a command carrying `LOVE_NO_IMAGE`. So does a bare word that would inherit its standard input, since a word with nothing after it may mean the repl and the forked child is in no position to make that isatty call -- but a stage whose standard input is a pipe or a redirect has already answered the question, and forks.

For a caller already in the image there is one more door. `sh-oneline` runs a single line the way a subshell would -- output straight onto the caller's fds, and the state a fork would have copied put back by hand, the same roster the command-substitution paragraph above lists. **cook**(1) uses it for recipe lines, which is what lets a whole `CC=mooncc` build pay one image wake instead of one per translation unit. `exit`, `set -e` and `set -u` all end that line rather than the process.

# OPTIONS

**-c** *command* \[*name* \[*arg*...\]\]
:   Run *command* and exit. *name* becomes `$0` (default `lush`), the *arg*s the positional parameters. The command may span lines.
**-e**, **-u**, **-x**
:   The `set` flags, given at invocation. They bundle with each other and with **-c** in one word: `lush -ec 'cmd'` is what a Makefile's `.SHELLFLAGS` writes, and it is how lush can be the `SHELL` of a make.
**-a**, **-g**
:   The mode: **-a** autonomous (the default), **-g** gregarious, as the DESCRIPTION has them. They bundle like the flags above. With neither on the command line the shell reads `LUSHFLAGS` from the environment (the last **a** or **g** in it wins), which is how a whole build inherits one choice: **love seed** sets `-g` so a bootstrap through an ambient compiler and userland stays one, and `love seed -a` sets `-a`.
**--login**
:   A login shell: read */etc/profile*, then *~/.profile*, before anything else. A dash-led `argv[0]` (`-lush`, `-sh`, the mark **login**(1) leaves) is honored too, but the `env -S` shebang usually eats it -- the flag is the reliable door.

With no operands lush is interactive when stdin is a terminal, and reads commands line by line (gathering continuations) otherwise. A *script* operand runs the file, with the remaining operands as positional parameters.

# INVOCATION FILES

A login shell reads */etc/profile* then *~/.profile* first, whatever mode it runs in. An interactive shell then reads `$ENV` when set, else *~/.lushrc*. A broken line in an rc file scares back to the prompt; it cannot take the shell down.

# BUILTINS

The external tools stay external; the builtins are the ones that must run inside the shell's own process: **cd**, **pwd**, **exit**, **export**, **command**, **read**, **set**, **shift**, **unset**, **eval**, **.**, **wait**, **local**, **break**, **continue**, **return**, **jobs**, **fg**, **bg**, **:**, **true**, **false**, **ev**. `return` inside a `.`-sourced file stops that file (the POSIX dot-return), which is how */etc/profile.d* guards bail early.

`ev EXPR ...` joins its arguments into one love form, evaluates it in the shell's own image -- lush *is* love, so no process is spawned -- prints the answer, and exits with its truth bit: positive is true, so `ev 1 + 2` prints `3`, and `if ev -n '3 > 2'` takes the then-arm -- QUOTED, since a bare `> 2` is a redirect, and `-n` because a condition wants the status without the answer. That condition is the one thing `${(`*form*`)}` cannot give you, an expansion being a word and not a command. A string answers its bytes, so `x=$(ev '"a b"')` holds `a b`; anything else prints in love notation, so `ev '[1 2 3]'` prints `(1 2 3)`. `-n` says nothing and answers the status alone. A binding the form makes outlives the line, since the image is the shell's. An unfinished or raising form is a message on standard error and status 1 -- never a dead shell. QUOTE THE FORM: the shell's own lexer runs first, so `(`, `*`, `"` and `$` reach love only inside quotes.

It is deliberately **not** spelled `love`. A builtin shadows its PATH twin, and the interpreter and this lane spell their arguments differently -- everything after `ev` is one form, so `love -e "1 + 2"` under that name would read `-e` as a datum, fold it into the application, and answer `3.0` for `3`. The two want different command lines and isolated processes, so **love**(1) stays the binary's word and spawns like any other program.

# MAKING IT YOUR SHELL

Point a terminal emulator at `lush` (installed on PATH by `make install`) -- terminal shells are interactive non-login, so *~/.lushrc* is the file to season. For **chsh**(1), add the absolute path (`~/.local/bin/lush` resolves to the nest) to */etc/shells* and `chsh -s` it; a display manager or **login**(1) then spawns it with a dash `argv[0]` that the shebang drops, so a login-shell entry is best expressed as a two-line wrapper script `exec lush --login "$@"` -- or by sourcing your profile from *~/.lushrc*.

# EXIT STATUS

The status of the last command; `exit N` and a script's final `$?` pass through. `127` when a script operand does not exist, `2` on a syntax error or unexpected end of file.
