# kore — the multi-call toolbox

crew/kore/ orients here; the laws live in crew/kore/law.l, the GNU-identical smokes in
`make test_kore`, and every doubt settles by probing the built `kore`.

kore is the distro's coreutils: the love-native POSIX environment over the Linux kernel is
kernel + a static `love` + .l files, and kore is busybox's multi-call trick done natively.

## the shape

ONE roster — the `$(korefiles)` list in crew/build.mk: kore's own toolboxes, lib/lint.l,
crew/vi/, tools/ain.l, the lush files, crew/cook/cook.l and the holo linker files. The
crew rides IN the default binary's own layered image (doc/misc/plan/one-binary.md), so the
build tree's spelling is `love kore TOOL` and the installed `bin/kore` is a two-line verb
shim — re-evaling the cat per spawn costs ~1.3s, so only the distro, which has no image
to ship, still runs it as a shebang script.
`crew/kore/kore.l` loads LAST and dispatches off the program seat of `cmdline`: `kore TOOL
ARGS..`, or symlink a tool's name to kore and argv[0] picks it (how the distro shadows at
will). The registry is a tablet, so tool names never collide with the globals they call (the
`mkdir` applet CALLS the `mkdir` nif; different namespaces).

The file discipline, two shapes:

* **a tool with a seat** (tools/ain.l, crew/cook/cook.l): define-only, leaking
  one `<tool>-main`; a body-having tail fires it iff the file's own basename
  sits in the program seat — so the same file is a standalone tool AND a quiet
  cat member.
* **a toolbox** (core.l, fs.l): many mains, NO seat — kore is its door.

## the inventory (93 tools, 96 names)

| where | tools |
| --- | --- |
| kore.l (thin mains) | diff (the patience/myers engines), as (elf64 over the holo book), ar (GNU-shape archives + the ranlib index over ld-read, byte-identical smoke), ld (holo's static linker: -pie/-t/-Ttext, byte-identical to mooncc's own link), objcopy (a linked ELF flattened to `-O binary` or `-O ihex`, byte-identical to llvm/gnu objcopy on both) |

## the discipline (why this stays trustworthy)

* **GNU to the byte.** Every tool with printable output is smoked byte-identical against the
  real GNU tool in `make test_kore` (LC_ALL=C for sort/ls). The fussy faces are pinned
  deliberately: wc pads every field to the digit width of the byte TOTAL; uniq -c wears width
  7; nl is pad-6 + tab and a blank line is seven bare spaces; head/tail banner many files with
  `==> name <==`; ls -a is GNU -A; `base64 -w 0` ends with no newline at all. Effects
  (cp/mv/rm/..) are smoked by acting and then verifying with the shell, and the encodings are
  smoked over a BINARY file, which is the only input that says anything.
* **the u-floor.** The shared helpers leak u-prefixed from core.l and are lawed pure in law.l:
  uatoi uread udie upad ujoin uhdr uhead/utail ucount ubase/udir usplit ujoinc uspec/upick
  uset urev uwords upad/urpad ueach, core.l's ucol/utac/ufold/uexpand/uunexpand and the
  coder trio ubenc/ubdec/ubwrap, fs.l's uoct/udirp/udest/ucopy/rp-parts, and proc.l's
  udur plus the /proc floor (uprocs ustatf upstat upcmd uclk uhms utty uupsay umeminfo
  usignum). `ueach` is the cat walk every whole-input tool rides (files or stdin, `-`
  reads stdin, a miss complains on err and the exit code remembers).
* **the exit door.** A main ANSWERS its status as a charm; it does not quit. A leave from deep
  inside a walk rides `udie`, which says its sentence and then `uleave` — a scare carrying the
  status — and `urun` is the driver both faces come back through, flushing the ports and
  answering the charm. So the seat is the one site that quits (`kore-main` answers, and the
  tail of kore.l quits with it), and a caller staying in the image lives through a tool that
  fails: `kore-main` is the in-image door, taking `(link "kore" "ls" "-l")` and answering the
  status. mooncc rides the same floor with two doors of its own — `moon-run` answers, `moon-main`
  quits with what it answers (doc/misc/moon.md). ⚠ nothing unwinds through a scare, so a port a tool
  still holds at the leave is lost, exactly as `quit` lost it. The property is gated in
  test/gate/kore.sh and test/gate/moon.sh; a regression to `quit` passes every other check.
* **the nif lane.** fs effects ride src/posix.c (app-glob AiNif, no core edit) and its
  `posix_` conventions: an effect op answers () ok | -errno | EINVAL misuse; a value
  op answers the value | () | -errno. src/posix.c holds rename symlink readlink chmod chown utime
  umask rmdir hardlink (`link` the word belongs to the chain ctor). test/host/fs.l smokes them
  under test_hostnif. ⚠ **`()` and `-errno` are BOTH falsey**, so a tool asks the KIND —
  crew/kore/fs.l's `uok?` (`!(charm? e)`) — and never `!e` or a bare `? e`. That mistake is
  per call site and silent: every miss reports success. test/gate/kore.sh carries a
  failure row per tool because of it.
* **exit codes.** 0 clean, 1 something failed (reported on err, the loop continued), 2 usage;
  diff keeps its classic 0/1/2 triple.

## traps

* `show` is the decimal formatter; `string` of a number makes a ONE-CHARM text.
* prel `sort` on strings IS lexicographic (probed via the "b"-vs-"ab" discriminator), which is
  exactly LC_ALL=C — no comparator needed.
* a symlink TARGET resolves relative to the LINK's directory, not the cwd.
* lines/unlines normalize an unterminated final line (the tool layer's ONE normalization); cat
  copies verbatim, head/tail/sort/uniq normalize like GNU sort does (GNU head does not — known,
  harmless, unsmoked).
* a value that can legitimately net 0 — an end index, a (0 0) span — reads BLUE (falsy): give
  it uread's (1 ..) success shape. And never name a local `err` or `out`; they are the PORTS,
  and the shadow says into a charm.

## the column tools, the encodings, tsort and factor (crew/kore/core.l)

`fold`, `expand` and `unexpand` are one section because they share `ucol`: all three count
COLUMNS, so a tab steps to the next stop, `\b` steps back one and `\r` starts the line over.
`fold -b` asks for bytes instead, `-s` backs the break up to the last blank, `-w N` and the
obsolescent `-N` both say the width; `expand -t N -i`; `unexpand -a`, and `-t N` means `-a`
too, as GNU's does.

* ⚠ **a tab lands only where it saves at least two columns**, which is why a lone space
  sitting on a tab stop stays a space. It is the one rule the obvious unexpand gets wrong.
* fold breaks BEFORE the charm that would overflow, so a charm wider than the whole width
  still gets a line of its own.

`base64` and `base32` are one coder over two alphabets (RFC 4648): 3 bytes to 4 charms at 6
bits, 5 to 8 at 5, the short tail padded with `=` either way. `-d` reads it back — a newline
is ignored, anything else outside the alphabet is refused with exit 1 — and `-w` says the
wrap, 76 unsaid.

* ⚠ **`-w 0` closes nothing.** GNU ends a wrapped last line with a newline but leaves one
  long line without one, so the obvious implementation is a byte too long.

`tsort` answers **a** topological order and not GNU's: where the input pins one they agree,
and where it does not both are right, so the gate only asks about inputs that pin one. A loop
is named on err, broken at the first node still standing, and leaves 1. `factor` is trial
division by 2 and the odd numbers — exact for anything this tree spends, and a twenty-digit
semiprime will simply sit there, which is what GNU keeps a Pollard rho for.

## the regex engine (crew/kore/re.l)

A POSIX-BRE dialect — literals, `.`, `*`, head-`^`/tail-`$`, [..] classes with
ranges/negation (first-] and edge-- literal), \-escapes, \( \) groups, GNU's \+ \? — with
GNU's leniency (a repeat with no atom is ink) and GNU's refusals mirrored as parse errors
(backrefs, intervals, alternation). `(rebre p)` answers `(1 nodes ngroups)` | `()`; `(rehas
nodes s)` the boolean; `(refind nodes s i)` the leftmost greedy span as `(1 start end)` — the
`(1 ..)` shapes because a match ending at 0 is blue by measure. The matcher is greedy
backtracking in continuation style; the laws hold the dialect by hand AND by a seeded
differential fuzz against an independent Brzozowski-derivative oracle. grep rides it: -n -v -c
-l, GNU-byte-identical smokes + the 0/1/2 exit triple (an unreadable file beats a match).
`refind` carries group SPANS (numbered in \( order, a repeated group reading as its LAST
iteration, GNU's \1) — sed's food.

## sed-lite (crew/kore/sed.l)

Over re.l. `sed [-n] SCRIPT [FILE..]`: ;/newline-separated commands, each [ADDR[,ADDR]] VERB;
addresses number/$/(BRE)/re/, ranges open-at-first close-at-later (numeric end at-or-before
start = one line, like GNU); verbs p, d, q (one address), and s/RE/REPL/[g][p] with any
delimiter — & and \1..\9 in the replacement, the POSIX empty-match rules exact (step after an
empty replacement, DISCARD an empty match where the last one ended: `s/x*/-/g` on "xbz" is
"-b-z-"). Input is the concatenated stream ($ = its last line); unreadable files
complain-and-flow, exit 2; a bad script exits 1 (GNU's split). The pure floor (sparse, usub) is
lawed; the whole face is smoked byte-identical vs GNU (a 12-script battery + -n + stdin + the
error faces). Out of dialect, deliberately: GNU's empty-pattern reuse, \n in replacements, hold
space.

## the process tools (crew/kore/proc.l)

No new nifs — environ/getenv/setenv, spawn (pid | negative errno; a child that cannot exec
_exit(127)s) + wait, still (pty.c's kill), rest (core sleep, ms). env prints the world or
assigns K=V.. and runs the command with the child's exit; sleep sums decimal durations with
s/m/h/d suffixes (udur, lawed); kill sends -N or -NAME (default TERM) per pid, exit 0/1; xargs
whitespace-splits stdin (quote-blind, deliberately) onto the command's tail (echo by default),
-n N a batch at a time, exits 0 / 123 (a run failed) / 127 (could not exec), running once even
on empty input, all like GNU. `printenv` prints the world or just the names asked for (a name
with nothing in it says nothing and the exit remembers); `whoami` and `groups` are id's two
thin faces, so they read /etc/passwd and /etc/group exactly as id does. `arch` and `nproc`
live in core.l beside uname, which is the other tool that reads the machine: arch IS uname -m
and ⚠ nproc counts what /proc/cpuinfo names, which is GNU's `--all` — nothing here reads an
affinity mask.

## awk (crew/kore/awk.l)

A POSIX awk: BEGIN/END, `pattern { action }` items, `expr, expr` ranges, fields with `$0`
rebuilding on either side, the special variables (NR NF FS OFS ORS FILENAME FNR SUBSEP RSTART
RLENGTH CONVFMT OFMT), arrays with `in` and `delete`, user functions whose array parameters
pass **by reference**, and the builtins length substr index split sub gsub match sprintf sin
cos atan2 exp log sqrt int rand srand tolower toupper system close. `-F`, `-v var=value`,
`-f progfile` (repeatable) and command-line `var=value` between file arguments. Regexes are
re.l's ERE dialect; the whole language is smoked byte-identical against gawk in `make
test_kore`, the pure floor is lawed.

Three pieces are worth knowing before reading it:

* **the value is four-faced.** `()` uninitialised, a number, a string, and `('sn n s)` — a
  STRNUM, the thing that came off input looking like a number. It must compare as a number and
  print as the text it arrived in: `"007"` from a field is 7 to `==` and `007` to `print`. Two
  numeric-ish values compare numerically, anything else as text, and that one rule is why the
  field carries both faces rather than one.
* **the numbers are ours.** `show` prints a double round-trip exact; awk owes `%.6g`. So
  aw-fixed/aw-expo/aw-gen do the digits by hand off a normalised mantissa, and aw-sprintf is a
  real printf (flags, width, precision, `d i o u x X c s e E f g G`). They round half away from
  zero where C rounds half to even — a difference an exact decimal tie can reach and a computed
  double essentially never does.
* **`nil?` is a TRUTH test, not a type one.** It answers 1 for `0`, for `-4` and for `""` as
  readily as for `()`. awk leans on the difference every line, so the empty question is asked by
  identity (`aw-nil?` is `(id? v ())`) and never by truth. Getting this wrong prints `0` as `""`.

Out of dialect, deliberately — each a rung, not an oversight: **getline** in every spelling
(it is the one construct that makes the record loop re-entrant, and half a getline is worse
than none); **output pipes** (`print | "cmd"` — plain `>` and `>>` to a file are here);
**RS** other than newline; **ARGV/ARGC and ENVIRON** (the arguments are walked, not published);
printf's `*` width and `#` flag.

## find (crew/kore/find.l)

`find [PATH..] [EXPR]`, PATH defaulting to `.`. Primaries `-name` `-path` (fnmatch, via lush's
`sh-match`) `-type f|d|l` `-print` `-prune` `-exec CMD.. ;` `-true` `-false`, the global
`-maxdepth`/`-mindepth`, and the operators `( )` `!`/`-not` `-a`/`-and` (implicit between two
primaries) `-o`/`-or`, both short-circuiting, `-a` binding tighter. An expression naming no
action gets `-print`, exactly as GNU does.

* **the walk sorts each directory.** GNU hands out readdir order, which is the file system's
  business and repeats for nobody — so `find | sort` on both sides is the only honest way to
  smoke us against it, and that is what the gate does. Sorted is also what a build wants: the
  same tree cuts the same image twice.
* **symlinks are not followed** (GNU's `-P`, the default). The `stat` nif follows, so the type
  read asks `readlink` FIRST — a link answers `l` whatever it points at, and the walk does not
  descend through it. A dangling link is still visited.
* it loads late in the cat because it captures `sh-match` at its define; crew/build.mk says so.

## expr, and the record tools (crew/kore/expr.l, crew/kore/core.l)

`expr` is the one applet with a grammar: `|`, `&`, the six comparisons, `+ -`, `* / %`, `:`,
then the primaries (`( )`, `length`, `substr`, `index`, `match`, `+ TOKEN`, a bare word). Its
own file because `:` rides re.l's BRE engine, and a body captures its free names at its define.

* **every value is a TEXT**, and a text that reads as a whole number is a number wherever one
  is wanted. That one rule is the whole type system: `2 < 10` is 1 and `2 < 10a` is 0, because
  the second pair has no number in it.
* the **exit code is a third channel** — 0 the answer is neither `""` nor `"0"`, 1 it is, 2 the
  expression will not do — so the gate compares stdout *and* `$?` on every check.
* ⚠ **the division truncates toward zero and the remainder wears the dividend's sign**, which is
  C's rule and expr's. love's `//` FLOORS, so the sign is taken out and put back rather than
  divided with; `-7 / 2` is -3 and `-7 % 2` is -1.

`paste`/`comm`/`join`/`split`/`od` read whole files rather than riding `ueach`, because each
walks several at once. Three things are worth knowing:

* **paste's delimiter list cycles per GAP and starts over each row**, and the list advances with
  the separator it spends — never with the cell, since the first cell spends none.
* **join is a relational join**: a key repeated on either side makes the whole cross product,
  file-1-outer. `-o`, `-e` and `-i` are out of dialect (an output template is its own language).
* **od takes ONE -t per run**, the last given winning. GNU's several-at-once lane re-widens every
  column to the widest type in the set, which is a whole layout of its own and not another row.

## the checksums (crew/kore/sum.l)

`cksum`, `md5sum`, `sha256sum` — the file whole, its bytes digested, one line said. The two
faces are GNU's: cksum's `CRC BYTES NAME` (and no name at all reading stdin), the digest pair's
`DIGEST  NAME` with the two spaces that mean text mode. `-c` reads such a list back and says
`NAME: OK` / `NAME: FAILED` per line, leaving with 1 if any did not match; the gate holds both
directions, GNU reading ours and ours reading GNU's.

The digests themselves are **src/hash.c** (`sha256`, `md5`, `cksum` — the last being POSIX's
own crc, a different polynomial from `crc32`'s and with the byte count folded in, which is why
an empty file is `4294967295 0`). There is no love statement of any of the three, so an image
that carries no host nif — the kernel's, which compiles no `host/*.c` — answers 2 and names the
digest it is missing rather than saying a wrong number. The probe is asked at first call and
kept, never at load: this file is baked by a love that HAS the nifs.

## what the fs tools report (crew/kore/fs.l)

`realpath` walks a path COMPONENT BY COMPONENT — resolving each symlink as it arrives — so a
last name that does not exist yet still answers, which is GNU's default face and the case a
resolver written around one `stat` gets wrong. `-e` wants the whole path to be there, `-m`
allows any of it to be missing, `-s` takes the links as they lie. ⚠ `readlink -f` beside it is
STRICTER than GNU's (it wants the path to exist), which is GNU's `readlink -e`; realpath is
the GNU-shaped door. `link` and `unlink` are the two syscalls said plainly, no face on them.

`stat -c FORMAT` (or `--printf=`, which reads the escapes and adds no newline where `-c` does
neither), `du`, `chown`, `mktemp`. They read the **stat tail**: src/posix.c's `stat` answers
`(size mtime mode ns uid gid nlink blocks ino)` and `lstat` the same of the link itself. The tail
is append-only and the KERNEL's own stat (src/kmain.c) answers the first four alone — an image
tree has no ownership to tell about — so it is asked by `tally` and a world without it says so.

* ⚠ **there is no default `stat` face.** GNU's is four lines of access, change and birth times
  and a device number, none of which this stat carries. Printing the modify time three times over
  would be a fabrication, so the tool asks for `-c`.
* **du counts `st_blocks`, which is allocation and not size** — a sparse file costs less than it
  measures, a tiny one costs a whole block — and reports 1K units rounded up. `-b`'s apparent
  size counts a FILE's `st_size` and a directory's **not at all**, which is GNU's rule and not a
  guess: an empty directory whose st_size is 40 reports 0. A hard link is counted once per run,
  keyed by inode alone (this stat carries no device). Like find's, the walk sorts each directory.
* **`mktemp` MAKES the name** — `openfd` mode 3 is O_EXCL at 0600, and `-d` an exclusive mkdir —
  so the answer is a fact by the time it is printed, not a proposal.
* **`id`'s supplementary groups are read out of `/etc/group`**: there is no `getgroups` here and
  no NSS anywhere. The primary comes first, then the rest ascending, which is the order the
  kernel keeps its credential list in and so the order GNU prints.

## the /proc family (crew/kore/proc.l)

`ps`, `free`, `uptime`, `pidof`, `pgrep`, `pkill`, `killall` and `pwdx`. **No nif grew for
any of them** — /proc is a filesystem, so the whole family is `uread` and a parser, and a
world without one (the kernel's own image, which mounts no procfs) reads as *no processes*
rather than as an error.

* ⚠ **the comm is taken between the FIRST `(` and the LAST `)`** of a stat line, never by
  splitting on spaces: a program may be named `(sd-pam)` or `a b)c`, and a naive split
  reads its parentheses as fields — silently, since every field after it then shifts.
* **`ps` bare is procps' rule**: the processes that are ours *and* share this terminal.
  The owner comes off `/proc/PID` itself, whose directory the process owns — one stat
  where `/proc/PID/status` would be a second read and a second parser. `-e`/`-A`/`a`/`x`
  take every process. The columns are procps' to the space; TIME is USER_HZ 100 and
  truncates, and the hours are never clipped (`100:00:00` is a real answer).
* **`free`'s used is total minus AVAILABLE**, not total minus free — the kernel's own
  estimate of what a new program could have is the only honest reading, and it is what
  procps prints. `-m` and `-g` divide; `-h` is not here (its rounding is a layout).
* ⚠ **`uptime` has no `N users` field** and will not get one: that count comes out of
  utmp, which this tree does not keep, and a fabricated 0 is worse than an absent field.
  The time of day is UTC, for the reason the clock section gives.
* **the by-name four** match the COMM, which the kernel caps at fifteen charms; `pgrep -f`
  asks the cmdline instead, where a long name survives, and `-x` wants the whole of it.
  `pgrep`/`pkill` never match themselves. The signal spelling (`-9`, `-TERM`) is `kill`'s
  own table, shared.
* the faces are **not smoked byte-for-byte** — the process table moves between two runs —
  so the parsers are lawed and the faces are asked about a process the gate made itself:
  in `ps -e`, found by `pidof`, gone after `pkill`. ⚠ and the gate kills a COPY of sleep
  under its own name, because `killall sleep` on a shared box reaches into other people's
  work.

## the clock (crew/kore/proc.l)

⚠ **UTC and only UTC.** There is no tz database in this tree, so localtime IS gmtime — the same
call nolibc made, for the same reason. `date -u` is taken and changes nothing. `-d @SECONDS` and
`-r FILE` name a moment other than now, which is also the only thing that makes the tool gateable
against GNU at all; the gate runs the oracle under `TZ=UTC`. The calendar itself is Hinnant's
exact integer civil-from-days in core.l (`ucivil`/`udays`, lawed by the round trip), which stat's
`%y` reads too.

## patch (crew/kore/patch.l)

The other half of diff.l: that file WRITES unified hunks, this reads them back and lays them on
a tree. `-pN` (unsaid drops every leading directory, patch's own default), `-R`, `-i`, `-o`,
`--dry-run`, `-s`. **Unified diffs only, deliberately** — context and normal format are two more
parsers for a shape nothing in this decade emits.

* a FILE is a list of `(text nl)` pairs. **A missing final newline is data** here as everywhere in
  kore, and a patch can both carry one in and take one away, so the flag rides per line.
* ⚠ **the `\ No newline at end of file` line is tested before the counts run out.** It carries no
  count of its own, so the one closing a hunk arrives after both counters have hit zero — a body
  that stopped on the counts alone leaves every "the patch takes the newline away" case unmarked.
* applying carries a **delta**: the running difference between a seat in the original and the same
  content's seat now. A hunk that does not sit where it says searches outward from there, which is
  what `offset` in patch's report means — and the reach is `n + 1 + |want|`, not `n`, because a
  create hunk's `-0,0` wants seat -1 in a file of no lines.
* a rejected hunk lands in `NAME.rej` **byte-identical to GNU's**, the original in `NAME.orig`,
  and the exit is 1. The `.orig` lands on a MISMATCH and not only on a failure — GNU's
  `--backup-if-mismatch`, since a hunk that moved applied to a file the patch did not describe.
* the gate's oracle is **the tree, not the message**: GNU patch's chatter has moved between
  releases; what it leaves on disk has not.

## not built

Polish, as need arises: ls -l (stat already carries size/mtime/mode), cp -r, multi-source cp/mv
into a directory, sort -n/-k, uniq -d/-u, cut -b, tr [:class:] and -ds, echo -e, seq over gems,
grep -i/-o/-E, sed -i/y/N, join -o, od with several -t at once, date's spellings past `@SECONDS`,
the checksums' `-b`/`--tag` output modes and `-c`'s `--quiet`/`--status` (a `-c` list written either
way still READS here).
`df` is the one that wants a NIF and not an afternoon: nothing here answers `statvfs`.
Left out of the coreutils batch deliberately: `fmt` `pr` `csplit` `ptx` `numfmt` (each its own
layout language, not another row), `dir`/`vdir` (they are `ls -C` and `ls -l`, neither of which
ls wears yet), `shuf` (it wants a decision about the seed before it wants code), `sha1sum` and
the sha512 family (src/hash.c carries sha256, md5 and cksum alone), and `who`/`users`/`logname`
(no utmp here, and there will not be one).
Out of the /proc family, deliberately: `top` (a full-screen loop, and its data is `ps`'s),
`pmap` and `vmstat` (each its own layout), `dmesg` (the ring buffer wants a syscall, not a
file).
None block the distro; add them when a real script wants them.
