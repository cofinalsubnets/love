# moon — the C compiler, in love

`mooncc` is a C compiler written in love (chibicc was the seed), emitting through the holo books. With
`src/core/holo/link.l` (our static linker) and `src/apps/moon/lib/` (our libc, math floor and machine
tail) it is a **complete C toolchain that borrows nothing**: love builds itself with no gcc, no
glibc and no ld, and the kernel is built by it too.

The closure it buys: love-in-love compiles the compiler that compiles love.c.

**The one firm fence: NOT C++, ever.**

`make test_moon` is the gate; `make test_raw` runs the whole corpus on a gcc/glibc/ld-free build;
`make test_fixpoint` proves `mooncc(mooncc(love))` byte-identical to `mooncc(love)`;
`make test_drv` gates the driver conventions; `make test_libc` differentials the library. See for the kernel lane for diagnostics and
doc/misc/moon-c-gaps.md for the dialect's edges.

## the subset, measured off love.c

The dialect is not "C11-ish" by taste — it is what the target demands:

* the whole statement/expression core; switch, goto (plain labels only — NO computed goto),
  do/while/for, the comma operator.
* typedefs, structs, unions, enums, nested aggregates, a flexible array member, designated
  initializers, ANONYMOUS unions and structs, compound literals.
* function pointers as first-class citizens — the lvm dispatch tables ARE the program. Pointer
  arithmetic throughout, multidimensional arrays.
* varargs, in the real SysV shape (below).
* the preprocessor in anger: object + function-like macros, variadic macros, `##` token paste,
  `#if`/`#ifdef` trees, `#include`.
* `double` and `float`; NO long double.
* `_Static_assert` (both the two-argument and the C23 one-argument form); `__attribute__`
  parsed and, where it matters, honored (`section(..)`, `always_inline`, `noinline`) — leading
  or trailing, on a declaration, a local, a parameter or a struct member.
* the gcc builtins a freestanding source reaches for: `offsetof`, `types_compatible_p` and
  `constant_p` (each a constant at parse), `trap`/`unreachable`, `expect`, the `clz`/`ctz`/
  `popcount`/`bswap` families, the `__sync` spin pair, and `memcpy`/`memmove`/`memset`/
  `memcmp`/`strlen`/`strcpy`, which ARE the plain functions and are declared on the way past.
* setjmp/sigsetjmp + signal handlers — the library's problem, not the compiler's; mooncc only
  needs the calls and the volatile discipline around them.
* the tail-threaded VM: `return Continue()` everywhere, with **guaranteed sibcalls** so the
  stack stays flat (below).

## the architecture

`src/apps/moon/`, the kore discipline: pure engines with law files, a thin driver, one gate per
piece. ~14k lines of love (law.l beside them).

* **floor.l** — the C type floor: the laws that are neither syntax nor codegen (the type shapes,
  `tysz`/`tyalign`, and the typing door — promotions and the usual arithmetic conversions),
  spelled once and read from both sides. Pure: the machine word and the struct-tag table arrive
  as PARAMETERS, so parse threads them off `ps`, gen off `g`, and neither owns the law. This is
  the file a front that is not `cparse` stands on — it names no token, parse state or register.
* **lex.l** — text → token list (pure). Tokens carry file/line for diagnostics, and a 4th field
  flagging a `(` GLUED to the preceding identifier — which is what distinguishes a function
  macro from an object macro whose body opens with a paren.
* **cpp.l** — token list → token list (pure). Token-based, so an identifier inside a string or
  char literal — already one opaque token — is never mistaken for a macro. Rescan to a fixpoint
  under Prosser's HIDESETS (the blue-paint token field, so `FOO`→`FOO` stops); `#` stringize;
  `##` paste (fold + relex); `...`/`__VA_ARGS__` and GNU's `, ##__VA_ARGS__` comma elision;
  the `#if` family over a precedence-climbing integer const-expr evaluator; `#include` through
  an `incf` hook so the laws can feed includes as data.
* **parse.l** — tokens → AST + the type layer. C cannot be parsed statelessly, so the parser
  carries state: typedef names, enum constants and the struct tag table, which ride out with
  the AST for gen's sizing. A local shadows a typedef or an enum constant for the rest of its
  block (pinned on the declaration, restored at `}`) — love.h makes `num`/`word` typedefs and
  love.c uses both as local variable names. A signature table (`ps 'sigs`: name → return type,
  parameter types, variadic bit) comes out as a fourth value.
  ⚠ **A read-modify-write may not duplicate its lvalue.** `x op= y` desugars to
  `(asn x (bin op x y))` and `++x` to the same — exact only when evaluating the lvalue leaves
  no trace, so `calm?` gates it and the other two doors take the address once: `++`/`--` ride
  `('post lv step)`, `op=` stays whole as `('rmw op lv rhs)` for gen to moor.
* **gen.l** — AST → holo IR (pure), **typed**: `cgexpr` answers
  `(type forms)`, so pointer arithmetic scales by pointee size, a dereference loads by pointee
  width, and an array decays to an address. Lvalues have one door (`clval`: the address in r0
  plus the pointee type), through which `x`, `*p` and `a[i]` all assign — and through which
  `('moor off ty)`, gen's own lvalue for an address already parked in a frame temp, lets an
  `('rmw ...)` reuse every store lane there is without evaluating its target twice. The ALU
  stays 64-bit —
  sound because signed overflow is UB — and widths bite only at memory and casts. This is also
  where the register story lives (its own section below).
* **clay.l** — C as love data (doc/misc/clay.md).
* **stage.l** — the pipeline's stages, typed: each pass's signature (input stage → output
  stage). The moon gate checks gen.l *as data* against it, so a new pass declares its sig there
  and a bad recomposition is a clash naming its seam.
* **moon.l** — the driver.
* **law.l** — the laws, ~1360 of them.

## the driver

```
mooncc [-c] [-pie] [-fno-inline] [-t TARGET] [-Ttext addr] [-I dir] [-D name[=val]] [-o out] in.c|in.o ..
```

Several inputs need `-c` and land each in the cwd as `x.o` (gcc-shaped); the old positional pair
`mooncc [-c] IN OUT` still reads. `-I` dirs search before our own headers on both include forms,
and ours are the ONLY standard set — there is no `/usr/include` tail. A header we do not carry
is refused by name, never resolved to whatever libc the box has (whose headers speak another
compiler and, off linux, another kernel).
A `-D` prepends a `#define` line to the source text before the one lex, so a function-like
`-DF(x)=..` rides the normal macro path (and diagnostics under `-D` skew by the define count).

Targets: `x64`/`x64`, `a64`/`a64`, `rv64`, `thumb2`/`cortex-m7`,
`thumb1`/`cortex-m0`, `thumb2sp`/`playdate`.

**`-std=` is a rail, not an advisory.** It is the one flag that says what *language* the
input is, so an unknown value refuses the compile rather than riding through ignored.

| `-std=` | dialect |
|---|---|
| *(unsaid)*, `moon` | **moon — the default.** Modern C plus the extensions below. |
| `c`, and `c89 c90 c99 c11 c17 c18 c23`, and each `gnu*` | strict C, no extensions, at whatever iteration we hover around (C11; doc/misc/moon-c-gaps.md) |

Every moon extension is syntax C **rejects outright**, so moon is a strict superset: no C
program means anything different under it, which is the whole licence for defaulting to it.
`-std=c` is the fence for when that matters.

⚠ there is deliberately **no `holyc`**. Struct labels are borrowed from HolyC, but a flag by
that name would refuse `U0`, `I64` and `class` — a parse error on line 1 of anything actually
written in HolyC, which is the one input that would reach for it. The name comes back when
it is true.

⚠ `-std=` is lifted off the command line by a **pre-pass**, never an accumulator on the flag
walk: that walk keeps one tablet now, and `-std=` names the *language* rather than a flag, so
it belongs before the line is read at all.

### struct labels

A label where a member declaration would start names an **offset**: a zero-width marker
that holds nothing and takes no space.

```c
struct S { char a; hdr: long b; int c; tail: };
```

`s.hdr` **is** the address — no `&` to write, which is the point of naming a position. It
is typed as a zero-length `char` array, so it decays the way `char hdr[0]` does while
staying an lvalue, which keeps `offsetof(S, hdr)` answering. It costs nothing: the struct
above has exactly the size and offsets of `struct { char a; long b; int c; };`.

⚠ **the alignment is the whole feature.** The idiom this replaces is a zero-length array
marker, `char hdr[0];` — a GCC/Clang extension — and it has alignment 1, so it lands where
the *previous* field ended and names the padding: gcc puts it at **4** where the `long`
sits at **8**. A label aligns as the member it precedes, so it names the member.

A **trailing** label aligns as the struct, so it is one past the *object* — `offsetof(S,
tail) == sizeof(struct S)`, `end()`'s convention. One past the *data* would sit inside the
trailing padding and point at nothing an array of `S` would ever reach. In a union every
label flattens to 0, like every other member.

`gen.l` never learned about any of this: a label is one more row in the stag table, which
is the seam holding. `test/cc/141-structlabel.c` is the battery's own check — guarded on
`__moon__`, so gcc compiles the label-free half and both compilers must still agree — and
the gate's oracle is the same struct with the labels deleted, compiled by gcc: identical
size, identical offsets.

### the macros we answer

`__mooncc__` says which **compiler**; `__moon__` says which **dialect**, and only the
second is a licence to use an extension — under `-std=c` this is still mooncc and the
extension is still refused.

Anything without `-c` is a **link**, through `src/core/holo/link.l`.

**The cc conventions** — `CC=mooncc` drives a gcc-shaped recipe unchanged:

- the **advisory** families (`-W..` `-O..` `-g..` `-f..` `-pipe` `-static`) ride through
  ignored -- less `-fno-inline`, which is real here (below) -- and so do glued `-l..`/`-L..`: the runtime is pulled by need, so the libc/libm a
  recipe asks for is already in the artifact before it asks, and a name we cannot satisfy still
  lands as a *named* undefined reference at the link rather than going quiet (a real third-party
  library has its own door — give the `.a` as an input). Lua's own `LIBS=-lm` is why this
  matters. ⚠ glued only: a bare `-l` refuses, since taking it would eat the next word as a
  library name and the one after it as an input;
- an exe link still owing strong symbols pulls the runtime **by need**, archive-fashion — nolibc
  + the am math + the mksys leaf, taken from the archive the binary CARRIES, or compiled from
  the toolchain root and cached under `out/cache/moon/` (below), so a set carrying its own
  `am.o` never meets a twin;
- `-nostdlib`/`-nodefaultlibs`/`-ffreestanding` turn that pull off;
- `-ffreestanding` ALSO says the standard's own word: it makes `__STDC_HOSTED__` 0, which is how
  a source asks (love.c asks it to choose the W^X mmap arena over the freestanding heap copy).
  ⚠ **Only that flag** — the rest of the family is a hosted program supplying its own runtime,
  which is exactly what `test_raw` is;
- `-nostdinc`'s whole job is done by design now: the `/usr/include` tail is gone, so a header
  we do not carry refuses either way. The flag rides through accepted-and-ignored for
  `CC=mooncc` recipes;
- `-fno-inline` (and gcc's `-fno-inline-functions`) is the one member of the `-f` family that is
  **real** here: it bars every splice for the whole TU, the same door
  `__attribute__((noinline))` opens one name at a time, and it **outranks `always_inline`** —
  the flag is an instrument before it is an optimization switch, and a source attribute that
  could override it would leave the reader with no way to say *read this function as written*.
  Splicing is semantics-neutral, so the answer never moves; what moves is what you can read.
  That is what it is for: comparing one function's codegen against another cc's is impossible
  when a splice has rewritten it into its caller. Gated by `test_moon`, both halves — that it
  bites, and that the answer is unchanged;
- the **semantic** refusals stay loud (`-shared`, `-Wl,`'s payload, `-m..`) — an ignored one
  would be the silent-no-op trap in a cc suit. ⚠ mooncc **refuses** a `-m` rather than ignoring
  it.

Errors speak on err and exit 1; usage exits 2.

## `.comment`, the producer record

Every executable our linker writes carries a `.comment` section — the same one gcc and clang
write, NUL-separated strings, no `SHF_ALLOC`, laid past `p_filesz` beside the symbol table, so
the program is the same program and the kernel maps not a byte of it. It answers the first
question anyone opening a strange binary asks: **what built this?**

It is a **union**, not a claim. Every input object's own `.comment` rides in ahead of ours,
first-seen order, deduped, and only then does the linker add its own word — `love`, whichever
door drove it, because it is one linker and the door carries no information the file needs. So a
link mixing a foreign object names both TOOLCHAINS and neither claims the other's code:

```sh
$ mooncc m.o gcc-built.o -o mix && readelf -p .comment mix
  [     0]  GCC: (GNU) 16.1.1 20260625
  [    1b]  love 0.1
```

⚠ **the version is `love-version`'s BASE half, never the whole id, and that is a law.** The VCS
suffix names the commit that built *the compiler*, so it would make `love1` — built by love0's
mooncc — and `love2` — built by love1's — differ at `e_shoff` and name a broken fixpoint where
the two compilers agree on every byte they *emit*. The base moves with a release, which both
generations share; `love0` is stamped `$(love_base)+bootstrap` for exactly this, and
`out/0/.love0cc` content-stamps that compile line so a `./VERSION` bump rebuilds it (make
tracks files, not flag strings, and a stale love0 would fail the fixpoint at a byte offset with
nothing to say about the cause). A reader wanting the commit reads `love-version` in `.rodata`.

Read it back without any binutils at all: `src/core/holo/elfsec.l`'s `(elfsec PATH ".comment")` answers the
`(1 bytes)` wrapper — an empty section is a real section. It works on gcc's objects and on every
target mooncc emits, cross-machine, for the reason anything here does: a section table is a
table. Gated by `test_moon`, both halves — the union over a foreign `.o`, and the exact string on
an all-ours link.

## the toolchain root

mooncc's own files — our headers (`src/apps/moon/include/`, glibc-ABI-faithful but NOT glibc's) and
the runtime sources the implicit link pulls — are found through three rungs, tried in order:

1. **the dev tree**, `src/apps/moon/` off the cwd;
2. **the installed nest**, `<seat>/../lib/love/moon/` — the loader's own seat walk, the
   `selfpath` nif. So `~/.love/bin/love` finds `~/.love/lib/love/moon/`, and a distro's
   `/usr/bin/love` finds `/usr/lib/love/moon/`. `the Makefile` lays them there.
3. **the carried source, in memory** — a bare binary with no nest anywhere inflates its own
   embedded archive (`source-gz`) and reads the toolchain slice out of a table: the resolver
   and the runtime walk take the table where they would have read the nest. Nothing is written
   to the filesystem, so `love cc hi.c` answers from any cwd on any kernel with no tree and no
   install — and a version's compiles can never ride a stale copy, because the source it reads
   is the binary's own.

The runtime itself rides COMPILED as well as in source: tools/mkrt.l lays each hosted
ISA's nolibc archive (x64/a64/rv64, ~1.5 MB of archive under DEFLATE, ~210 kB carried,
one inflate on the ISA a link asks for) beside the source blob, stamped with
`rtcid` — a pure hash of the include/ + lib/ slice. A link consults the cache, then the
carried archive (the blob lane by construction; a disk home only when its slice hashes to
the stamp, so a laid seed tree serves and an edited dev tree falls through to the compile),
then compiles. That is what makes the bare door ~0.2 s instead of the ~28 s member build,
still writing nothing.

Gate: `test/gate/dist.sh`'s bare leg compiles from an empty cwd with an empty HOME and
holds that HOME stays empty. ⚠ `cd` matters here -- from the repo root rung 1 serves and
rung 2 is never exercised -- so a gate for the installed nest has to leave the tree.

⚠ **The root is READ AT EACH CALL, never bound.** mooncc rides a baked image, and a captured
seat would fold the build tree's path into that image and ride it forever.

Owing symbols with NO root in reach is its own diagnostic, naming the owed symbols and the roots
searched — an absent toolchain and an incomplete link are different conditions and must not wear
the same face.

## the runtime (src/apps/moon/lib/)

* **nolibc.c** — the raw libc over one `__ai_sys` trampoline: a mini stdio (a FILE is a fd plus
  a flush buffer), a K&R first-fit malloc over mmap arenas, dirent over getdents64, the
  glibc-152B-to-kernel-32B sigaction fold with our own restorer, a numeric getaddrinfo,
  env/exec/termios/pty. Single-threaded like love: errno is one int, no locks. See.
* **mksys.l** — lays `sys.o`, the things C cannot say: the 7-slot syscall trampoline,
  `__sigsetjmp`/`siglongjmp` over our own layout inside the glibc-sized 25-long buffer (the
  signal mask in `buf[8]`, saved/restored by rt_sigprocmask — love.c's fault barrier is
  `sigsetjmp(env,1)`, so the mask is load-bearing), and `__ai_sigret` (the SA_RESTORER tail).
  Every encoding objdump-checked, the holo house rule.
* **math/am.c** — our transcendentals. sqrt exact, the seven within a few ulp; `make ulp` is the
  differential gate. `-lm` appears in no link.

⚠ **The CARRIED archive is asked first, and on a stock tree it is the whole answer** — the
binary's own stamped bytes cannot be improved on by a cache entry, so the key is cut only where
they were refused. That leaves the cache two populations: `tools/mkrt.l` cutting the carried set
under love0, which carries none, and a toolchain edited past the stamp. Both are a checkout,
which is why the cache seats itself at `out/` and `make clean` reaches it.

⚠ **The carried archives are per-ISA and kernel-neutral.** All three are cut under `-os linux`
and the pin does not reach the bytes: `impl.h` parts linux, freebsd and netbsd at RUN time on
`__ai_osv`, and `os.c` — the only member with an OS predefine in it — keeps its arms under
`#ifndef AiOsTranslate`. So a refusal here belongs to the TARGET, never the kernel: riscv has no
translation tables, so a BSD there owes a compile that `#error`s rather than quietly linking
linux's numbers.

**The pull is cached, content-addressed, as one archive.** A member has to be compiled before the
pull can see what it defines, so every link owing a libc nom paid for all 190 of them — ~23s of a
cold hello-world link's ~23s. They now ride `out/cache/moon/<sha>.a`, ONE archive per
(compiler, target), keyed on the target, the runtime tree's whole text (headers included — an
edited `stdio.h` changes what `nolibc.c` means) and the compiler's own identity. A warm link is
~0.15s. An archive and not 190 objects because the ranlib index IS the "what does this member
define" answer, written once and read back rather than recomputed on every warm link — and
because one file is one generation, whole the moment it lands and countable when the sweep asks
which to keep. It is holo's own `arbytes`/`arpull` at both ends, the same pair `kore ar` and a
user-named `.a` on the command line use.

⚠ **The compiler's identity is the image it woke**, by stat, plus the love's own — `love-image`
(doc/misc/snapshot.md), read as `(ev 'love-image)` because mooncc lives baked and a bare read folds.
A love that does not say falls back to every `*.image` beside it, which is what this was before
`love-image` existed: correct but far too eager, since re-baking a `kore.image` the link never
reads invalidated the runtime and cost a full rebuild. Hashing the compiler's `.l` sources
instead looks tighter and is a hole: edit `gen.l`, link once before the image catches up, and the
entry filed under the new sources holds the old image's codegen.
No identity — a love with no image file in reach — means no cache at all. Nor is anything else
owed it: no `out/`, an unwritable directory, a mangled entry (each is checked for its archive
magic) all fall back to compiling, silently. Entries land by `rename`, so parallel links cannot
tear one, and a miss sweeps all but the six newest generations. ⚠ **count, not age**: the rate
is the tree's own — a day of rebuilds mints more generations than a month of use does, and a
clock cannot tell the two apart. The `-c` path is not cached, and neither is a `.c` the user
named — this is the *implicit* runtime only.

**The crt0 switch is one weak symbol.** `__ai_start` is defined WEAK in the crt0 object (the
bare call-main tail every small link gets), and nolibc overrides it STRONG to unpack
argv/envp/auxv before main — no link-time flag anywhere, the weak machinery IS the switch.

## the ABI

* **Arguments** ride the SysV registers (r6 r5 r2 r1 r7 r8 in holo's neutral file); args 7+ ride
  the caller stack, arg7 shallowest, caller cleans, odd counts padded for 16-alignment; the
  callee reads them at `rbp+16+8k`.
* **Varargs are real SysV.** The `va_list` is the 24-byte
  `{int gp_offset; int fp_offset; void *overflow_arg_area; void *reg_save_area;}`, a typedef to
  `__va_list_tag[1]` so it DECAYS to a pointer when handed on. The callee prologue lays a
  176-byte register save area (6 gp @ +0 step 8, 8 xmm @ +48 step 16) and addresses its named
  register-passed params inside it; `va_start` seeds the offsets, `va_arg` walks the register
  area until its offset passes the limit, then the overflow area. The xmm registers are saved
  unconditionally (reading an xmm never faults), so the callee needs no `al` guard; the caller
  sets `al` = #xmm args.
* **`float` is 4 bytes in memory but always a double in an xmm register** — a load widens
  (`ldss`+`cvtss2sd`), a store narrows. Only the DECLARED type drives the 4-vs-8-byte choice.
  This is self-consistent and matches gcc for values representable in both.
* ⚠ **16-byte stack alignment is ours to keep.** A spill that outlives a nested call reserves a
  16-byte cell, never an 8-byte push — `rsp` must be 16-aligned at every call, or the first
  callee that stores aligned SSE to an rbp-relative slot (glibc's `fork` child path is the
  classic) takes a #GP. This is invisible to love.c's own code and to a `-O0` gcc differential,
  so it is gated directly (`test_moon`'s `g=id(fork())` program).
* ⚠ **rbx (holo r3) is callee-saved** and every function owns frame slot -8 for it; the gate
  links a mooncc callee against an `-O2` caller holding a loop bound live in ebx.

## the register story (the one build)

One world on every target since 2026-08-28 (the moon-ssa arc, closed): every seating
decision is made ONCE, on the AST, before any machine form exists — then one build per
function under those seats.

* **alive** — the single analysis. Per-statement liveness (the wrapsets), call
  crossings split hard/soft (a soft site costs its callee's TRANSITIVE hard count —
  a spliced body brings its memcpys; a musttail never splices, the contract owes the
  jump), the fn-level hard count as a PATH MAXIMUM (if takes its heavier arm, loops
  weigh ×8), read/touch censuses for ranking, and the protocol-quiet and d128 flags.
  One answer tuple feeds everything below.
* **upar** — the param verdicts. A home-register identity rides free; an arrival
  rides where staging can never clobber it (the arrival leaves the pool); a
  protocol-quiet body lets a quad arrival (r0-r3) ride; an int/uint param rides its
  arrival with one entry cvt while the file stays deep. d128 material refuses every
  verdict on the ISA whose mul/div pin the rax:rdx pair — a 3-operand d128 ISA
  keeps its verdicts.
* **ulloc** — the locals allocator. Raw mention counts rank (the loop weight breaks
  ties), disjoint spans share a seat, a name crossing a HARD call never takes a
  caller-saved seat, and a pool floor keeps expressions from going dry.
* **ubuild** — one build under the seats. The quad re-read (`qclob?`) verifies every
  ridden r0-r3 arrival against the built forms — its only legitimate def is its own
  entry cvt — and demotes ONCE on a surprise; the numbering guards (statement and
  decl ticks against alive's totals) bare the whole build instead of guessing. A
  memory sret and varargs take the bare spill build (one build there too, no seats).
* **the armed shadow** — every home reserves a spill slot, but the wrap attaches at
  call EMISSION, filtered by the statement's wrapset: a spliced call never wraps,
  and a home dead across a call keeps its register.
* **after the build** — sibcall (a musttail is owed its jump), the IR sweeps
  (in-build on x64; a64 sweeps at the post-choice seam where the frame base is
  settled fp, and `tailst` peels the dead straight-line stores a musttail leaves
  behind), repack's per-def chains (x64: a store-to-loads chain promotes over its
  OWN range, so one cell's call-free chain leaves the frame while its crossing
  sibling keeps the cell), frame elision, and the cs upkeep.

The economics that shaped this are doc/misc/moon-gauge.md (the two halves buy
different things: the pool half buys cycles with instructions, the cs half buys
latency at flat count); the arc that built it is doc/misc/plan/moon-ssa.md.

## sibcalls, and the flat stack

A RET-position call **tail-jumps**: the epilogue reloads rbx and `jmp F` replaces `call F`, so
deep tail recursion runs flat and the lvm shape Continues by jmp. The rewrite is a LOCAL
peephole (a call immediately followed by the exact epilogue, or by a join label leading to it),
gated per function by an **escape analysis** — a frame address that becomes a VALUE (the `&`
lane, a local array decaying, a struct-value rep, `va_start`'s save area) pins `fesc` and the
function keeps all its calls; an lvalue's own load/store rides `lean` and stays eligible.
And `__attribute__((musttail))` on a return is OWED, not opportunistic: the annotation rides
the ret's PRE slot, gen marks the call, and a shape the rewrite cannot take REFUSES the
compile (`musttail-not-a-tail` / `musttail-escape`) — the clang/gcc-15 semantic, which is how
love.h holds every VM tail to the jump under all three compilers. `make vmret` stays as the
cross-check on the shipped binary.

Predefines worth knowing: `__mooncc__`, `__linux__`, `__x86_64__` (or the target's twin), and
`__STDC_HOSTED__` = 1 for a hosted link / 0 under `-ffreestanding`. `__SIZEOF_INT128__` is
predefined on x64 alone (gen's d128 lane), which is what love.c's limb seam reads.

## inline asm

The GNU statement form, in the GNU dialect: the template is what clang and gcc read for the
target — AT&T on x64, ARM on a64, riscv, thumb — and `src/core/holo/gas.l` lowers it to the
neutral IR the baked assembler encodes. So a header says each instruction ONCE and every
compiler reads it (the kernel's `src/inle/<a>/asmops.h` carry no `#ifdef __mooncc__` at all);
no new encoder exists anywhere, every line lands on a backend row test/holo/golden.l froze.

    asm [volatile] ("mov $40, %0" : "=r"(v) : "r"(x), "i"(3) : "memory");
    __attribute__((holo)) asm ("li %0, 40" : "=r"(v));    // holo's neutral text instead

* Registers spell as the dialect does, at the operand's C width on x64 (a `uint8_t` is `%al`,
  a `uint16_t` `%dx`; the `%b0 %w0 %k0 %q0` modifiers override, `%c0` prints an immediate bare;
  a64's `%w0`/`%x0` pick w/x). The neutral file under `holo` is x64 r0=rax r1=rcx r2=rdx r3=rbx
  r4=rbp (the frame) r5=rsi r6=rdi r7..r14=r8..r15; a64 rN=xN; rv64 r0..r7=a0..a7.
* Constraints: `"r"`/`"=r"`/`"+r"` (and `q`/`g`/`rm`) pick a register, `"rN"` pins a neutral
  one, x86's `a`/`b`/`c`/`d`/`S`/`D` letters pin theirs and `"Nd"` is dx, a digit `"0"` ties an
  input to that output's register, `"i"`/`"n"` an immediate (parse-time constant; `"ir"` picks by
  whether the operand is one), `"m"` a memory operand (the address in a register, spelled as the
  dialect's base form). A `register T v asm("x0")` local pins wherever the asm names it — the
  a64/riscv way of pinning, and the only one those dialects have. `%0..%9` substitute (outputs
  first), `%%` a literal `%`; adjacent template strings concatenate.
* What a line may say is what the neutral IR carries: the 64-bit register ops, immediates
  (C expressions: `$~(1 << 2)`, `#(3 << 20)`), base + displacement memory, GNU's `1:`/`1f`/`1b`
  local labels, the system lane (control registers, msr, cpuid, in/out, SVM, VMX, the descriptor
  tables; mrs/msr/tlbi/dc/ic/at/brk/hvc; the csr pseudos, ecall/ebreak/unimp). x64's 32-bit forms
  ride the 64-bit op plus a zero-extend (`movl`, `addl`, `xorl`); the 8/16-bit register forms and
  indexed memory refuse. A template separates on `\n` or `;`, as GNU does. A line that fits
  nothing SCARES (`cc: internal error: gas-x64-op ..`) rather than dropping out.
* The body assembles AT CODEGEN into one opaque `('raw bytes)`: the IR passes barrier on raw,
  labels inside a template stay LOCAL to it, and no pass ever rewrites user instructions.
  External symbols cannot be named in a template — reach values through operands (`"r"(&x)`
  works, and the address-taken local also fences deadst).
* Operands stage through the machine stack, so calls inside operand expressions are safe, and
  any scalar lvalue output works (`*p`, `a[i]`). Float/struct/bitfield operands refuse.
* Registers an operand may take: x64 r0-r3 + r5-r10 (r3 rides every prologue's -8 slot; r4 is
  the frame and refuses), a64 adds r4 (x4, an argument register there). Clobbers: `"memory"`,
  `"cc"` and those registers need no action — an asm-containing function turns register HOMING
  off (`g 'hasasm`), so nothing lives in a register across any statement; a CALLEE-SAVED
  register (x64 r12-r15, a64 x11-x28, rv64's s-file) is pushed around the body; the stack and
  frame pointers refuse.
* Deferred until a consumer demands them: `"f"` float operands, asm goto, named `[sym]`
  operands, top-level asm, indexed memory operands.

## the installed shape

`make install` does not ship the cat as `bin/mooncc`. The compiler bakes WARM into
`lib/love/mooncc.image` (the live bake nif, doc/misc/snapshot.md) and `bin/mooncc` is a three-line sh
shim: `love wake mooncc.image mooncc "$@"`. The whole-cat
re-eval every compile would otherwise pay (~1.5 s wall) is paid once, at bake — a small-file
compile drops from ~0.77 s to ~0.02 s, gcc-class invocation latency.

What the shim still pays per compile is the wake and the process: ~56 ms each, measured over
eight one-function TUs (0.81 s through the shim, 0.37 s for the same eight through one image —
2.2×). `moon-run` is the door that skips it. It is the same compile as `moon-main` but it
ANSWERS its status as a charm instead of quitting, so one image compiles again after a compile
that failed, and a caller who holds the image pays the wake once for a whole build. `moon-main`
is `(quit (moon-run as))` — every shim above keeps its contract untouched. Objects laid warm
are byte-identical to the same compile run cold, including the ones laid after a failure;
test/gate/moon.sh holds both halves.

⚠ `moon-run` traps `'leave`, the u-floor's exit door (a `udie` anywhere in the compile rides it
out carrying the status), and passes its charm through. Every OTHER condition is a genuine
internal raise and gets the `cc: internal error:` sentence with status 1 — taking `'leave` for
one of those would print nonsense over every usage error and flatten its 2 to a 1.

⚠ The image is binary-specific (anchor-checked) and installs from the same build as `bin/love`
(strip keeps vaddrs, so the stripped install wakes it); a mismatched pair falls back to a fresh
boot with no `moon-main`, so never mix builds by hand.

⚠ A catted app is `#!/usr/bin/env -S love` plus the cat, so a bare `mooncc` runs on the PATH
`love` — a STALE install mis-runs it. Probe the repo cat with `./out/love out/mooncc`,
never a bare `mooncc`, until `make install` refreshes the PATH binary.

## testing

* Every pure piece is lawed in `src/apps/moon/law.l`: lexer goldens, cpp expansions, parser ASTs
  printed and compared, layout/alignment tables, gen goldens.
* **The differential oracle is `gcc -O0`**: same source, run both, compare stdout + exit code.
  The battery lives in `test/cc/*.c` and ONLY grows — every bug fixed adds its regression.
  ⚠ Differential programs must be **UB-free**: `pick(++i,++i,++i)` is unsequenced, and gcc
  legitimately disagrees.
* A seeded expression fuzz against gcc (`test_moonfuzz`).
* **An OUTSIDE corpus, and its own answers** (`test_cts`, all three targets): c-testsuite's
  220 single-file programs, each held to the stdout it ships. Every `test/cc` file was written
  here to pin a fault we had already met, so the battery says what we already know; these were
  written by people compiling other compilers, and their first run found **nine** programs
  mooncc built clean and answered wrong. All nine landed, 00219 (`_Generic` over a qualifier)
  last, so the wrong-answer roster is **empty** on all three targets and the rest is refusals,
  rostered with a cause apiece in `test/gate/cts.sh` and kept apart. ⚠ the roster is double-
  edged only when it is READ: five of its lines had gone stale by 2026-08-16 — four already
  fixed, and 00219 filed as a refusal when the truth was a live miscompile, which is what
  a gate nobody runs without an opt-in corpus buys you.
* Cross targets get their own gates (`test_cca64`, `test_ccrv64`, `test_thumb*`), and
  doc/mooncc-differentials records why a package on a cross target beats a test suite on one.
* The corpus itself is the deepest oracle: `test_raw` runs it over a gcc-free build,
  `test_fixpoint` pins the compile byte-for-byte.

## known gaps

`gen.l`'s header carries the live fence list — what is refused rather than fudged: `ptr+ptr`,
dereference of a non-pointer, assigning to an array. Also: `&bitfield`, and `++`/`--` on a
bitfield or a wide type. doc/misc/moon-c-gaps.md is the fuller map, and carries the by-value
aggregate lanes the cross targets still lack.

## the basement, and the go borrowings

Two ideas kept warm, neither committed:

* **a basement language under C, in the spirit of historical B.** This compiler's core is
  B-shaped already — one word type, typeless 64-bit registers, C's types a
  checking-and-conversion layer laid ON TOP of the word core (sized memory ops at the edges,
  words in the middle). love itself is B-kin the same way. So the basement may want to become a
  real, nameable layer: the typeless word language gen already speaks internally, possibly with
  its own thin surface syntax — useful for runtime shims, the crt0, compiler self-tests, and as
  the honest semantic floor the C dialect desugars onto.
* **syntactic refinements borrowed from go.** Candidates to weigh when the grammar is fuller:
  unparenthesized conditions with mandatory braces, `:=` short declarations, cleaner declarator
  spellings for the gnarly cases (function-pointer types especially). The fence stands:
  extensions, opt-in, never needed to compile plain C — love.c stays the gate and it is written
  in C.

## naming

crew `moon` (🍄 the glowing mycelium on holo's cave walls, a sibling to inle) and the binary
`mooncc`, which slots into the cc/gcc/tcc tradition and clears the `moon`(MoonBit) /
`moonc`(MoonScript) collision.
