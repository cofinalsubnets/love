# moon-c-gaps — the C that mooncc refuses, and the C it gets wrong

A **living ledger** of mooncc's conformance gaps: what C it refuses, what it mishandles, and
where the root cause sits. Rows get deleted as they land — this is a status surface, not a
history.

Everything below was probed against `love mooncc` (the crew layer). The recipes are included — reproduce
rather than trust, and re-verify any `parse.l`/`gen.l` anchor before editing.

Probe recipe:

```sh
printf 'int m(void){ return 0; }\n' >> q.c
out/host/love mooncc \
  -c -t amd64 -o /dev/null q.c
```

## is it a conforming implementation?

Not yet, and the bar is worth stating exactly, because mooncc has answered
**`__STDC_VERSION__ 201112L` since before any of C11 was in it** — that claim is the thing to
make true or stop making.

C11 §4 asks two things of a *freestanding* implementation: accept every strictly conforming
program, and produce a **diagnostic** for every violation of a syntax rule or constraint. Nine
headers come with it — `<float.h> <iso646.h> <limits.h> <stdalign.h> <stdarg.h> <stdbool.h>
<stddef.h> <stdint.h> <stdnoreturn.h>`. All nine ship as of 2026-08-14 (`iso646.h` and
`stdalign.h` were the two missing). **Hosted** conformance is a different arc entirely — it is
a question about the C library, not the compiler.

Four of the biggest holes are not holes at all once declared, and that is now done: atomics,
threads, complex and VLAs each have a `__STDC_NO_*` macro, and C11 counts an implementation
that says so as conforming without them.

What genuinely stands between here and freestanding C11, each row live above:

- **the `#line "file"` half** — the line half landed 2026-08-14, but the file operand is still
  dropped; it wants `__FILE__` to stop being one name per TU first. (The `#if` evaluator landed
  the same day, below.)
- **the diagnostic obligation**: a non-constant `_Static_assert` is let by today, which is a
  constraint violation passing in silence — the one class §4 names outright. The *channel* is
  no longer missing: `blame` (parse.l) files a sentence beside the watermark and `pfail`
  reports it in place of the generic near-token line, so a refusal can name the program's
  fault rather than the compiler's position.

**A duplicate label now refuses and names itself** (2026-08-18). C11 6.8.1p3 scopes a label to
its whole function; two of a name emitted one mangled label twice and every `goto` to it took
the first, in silence. ⚠ the deviation it buys: gcc's `__label__` makes two blocks' `L` two
labels, and that program refuses here.

**Landed 2026-08-16** (test/cc/142-syntax.c and 138-ucn.c hold them to gcc; the refusals sit in
test/gate/moon.sh), and the deliberate readings in them:

- **`_Thread_local`** (and gcc's `__thread`) is an ignorable specifier: no TLS, no threads
  (`__STDC_NO_THREADS__`), so a thread-local *is* the one static object — observationally
  right, and C11 gives the storage class no opt-out macro to refuse it under. ⚠ it is the row
  that would read wrong, in silence, the day threads arrive.
- **universal character names in an identifier**, the remaining half of a C99-mandatory row.
  A UCN names a code point, so `Å` and a raw utf-8 `Å` intern as one name and export the
  same symbol bytes gcc does. ⚠ a byte past 127 is now an identifier char everywhere, so a
  stray one outside a literal interns instead of scaring; Annex D's ranges are not enforced,
  which accepts more than C11 spells rather than less.
- **`switch (x) case 0: ;`** — `parm`, the brace-less if/while arms' own door, was already the
  shape a body of one wants.
- **`int f(int), a;`** — `one`/`more` hoisted out of the dispatch's inner scope, so the
  function-first list reaches the object lane mproto cannot take.
- **bare `typeof`**, and an attribute run **before** a struct/union tag.
- **an integer where a pointer is owed** — the §4 row that took `src/main.c`'s `return 1` in
  silence and handed back address 1. `return <non-zero literal>` from a `T *` now refuses and
  says so; a cast still passes, because a cast says the program means it.
- **`_Generic` over QUALIFIED types** (test/cc/143-genericqual.c) — the row below, and the last
  program in c-testsuite that compiled clean and answered wrong.

None of these is large on its own. The honest summary is that conformance here is a **ladder of
small rungs, not a rewrite** — and that the ledger below is the ladder.

## the syntax ledger

All of C89 passes. What remains is C99/C11/GNU.

### absent — a parse error, loudly

| construct | probe |
|---|---|
| `_Atomic` | `_Atomic int a;` — both spellings; `__STDC_NO_ATOMICS__` says so, which is C11's own door for the absence |
| statement expressions | `({ … })` |
| computed goto | `&&label`, `goto *p` |
| `asm goto` | costed below — the one refusal carrying an estimate |
| designated RANGE initializers | `[1 ... 5] = 9`, gcc's extension |
| the address of a compound literal in a **static** initializer | `struct S *p = &(struct S){1,2};` — inside a function it passes |
| brace elision continuing **past** an anonymous union member | `{1,2,3,{4,5}}` over `struct { int a,b; union { int c,d; }; struct S1 s; }` — elision *into* the union is fine |
| a `##` paste that makes a macro NAME | `CAT(A,B)(x)` where `AB` is itself a macro — the pasted name is not rescanned as an invocation |
| a register-exhausted **SSE**-class by-value argument | five float HFAs — the gp twin landed 2026-08-08 (below), this one did not |

The last five are what `test_cts` found (doc/misc/moon.md); `test/gate/cts.sh` names the program
each one came from.

### what passes, for contrast

The more surprising half, and all of it on every target unless the parity table below says
otherwise: designated initialisers (both `.field =` and `[i] =`), compound literals, K&R
definitions, bitfields including compound assignment, flexible array members, variadic macros,
`long long`, hex floats, anonymous unions, `restrict`, `static inline`, mixed declarations,
`for`-scoped declarations, `_Static_assert` (including `&&`/`||`/`?:` in the constant),
`_Generic` and `_Alignof` (landed 2026-08-14, below),
string-literal concatenation, self-referential structs, enum trailing commas, multidimensional
arrays, brace elision in nested initialisers, pointer-to-array declarators, functions returning
function pointers, multi-character constants (`'ab'` is 0x6162, gcc's packing, signed at four
chars), binary literals (`0b1010`, gcc's extension and C23's spelling), `__func__`, and
`__typeof__` over locals, globals, struct members, dereferences and function names.

**A block-scope `extern` declaration names the FILE-SCOPE object, landed 2026-08-25**
(test/cc/154-blockextern.c, held to gcc). C11 6.2.2p4: `extern int x;` inside a function
declares the external object — no slot, no local name, the linker binds it. It was binding a
LOCAL, so the body read and wrote a slot nothing else could see, and a `.o` carried no
reference to the symbol at all. ⚠ **a silent wrong answer, over a construct that reads like
nothing** — the class §4 cannot catch, since the program is strictly conforming and we
compiled it without a word. It is how the linux kernel and doom both reach a global from one
function without a header. The decls hoist to the TU's top as `('xdecl ..)`, where the global
pass already reads them, and C's tentative rule lets a real definition take the entry back.

**A float constant through a cast to an integer type landed 2026-08-25**
(test/cc/153-flocast.c, held to gcc) — C11 6.6p6's one float an integer constant expression
may hold, truncating toward zero. It folds in BOTH places, because they are different folds:
`cfold` (parse.l) is what an array dimension asks, and gen.l's `imgbytes` is what a static
initializer's image asks. ⚠ the parse half is the one that was answering WRONG rather than
refusing — an unfoldable dimension reads as a VLA, so `char d[(int) 3.9]` sized 8 in silence.
The row came off doom's `am_map.c`, which writes `((int)(-.867 * (1 << 16)))`.

**The GNU builtins and the attribute positions landed 2026-08-18** (test/cc/144-gnubuiltins.c
and 145-attrpos.c hold both to gcc):

- `__builtin_offsetof` rides `nulloff`, the fold the hand-written `&((T*)0)->m` idiom already
  took, so the two spellings cannot disagree; the designator's `.b` and `[i]` tail is the
  postfix ladder's own, seeded with the null deref.
- `__builtin_types_compatible_p` compares the MARKED types `_Generic` keeps (`pcqty`), so an
  inner `const` tells `const char *` from `char *` while a top-level one drops — and NOTHING
  decays, which is the question linux's `__must_be_array` asks it (`T[]` is not `T*`).
- `__builtin_constant_p` is 1 exactly where `cfold` settles the operand. ⚠ CONSERVATIVE by
  construction, and it must stay that way: a miss answers 0 and sends the consumer down its
  runtime lane, where a false 1 would hand it a constant that is not one. The operand is not
  evaluated, so its side effects are gone — gcc's rule.
- `__builtin_unreachable` rides the trap (`ud2`/`brk`). gcc emits nothing and lets the
  fall-through run into whatever follows, which is the one lowering that cannot be debugged.
- `__builtin_memcpy`/`memmove`/`memset`/`memcmp`/`strlen`/`strcpy` ARE the plain functions:
  parse rewrites the name and DECLARES it if nothing else has, since a program that spells the
  prefix is the one that never included the header. The link pulls the nolibc member by need.
- the `l`/`ll` counting spellings (`clzl`, `ctzl`, `ctzll`). x64's `bsf` and rv's ladder walk up
  from the low bit and were already 64-bit-shaped; only a64 owed a second encoding. On t32 the
  `l` spellings are the 32-bit lane (long is 4 there) and `ll` refuses with the other pair rows.
- an `__attribute__((..))` run TRAILING a local declarator, a parameter, or a struct member —
  the leading position was always skipped, and the kernel writes `__maybe_unused`/`__packed` in
  all four. The skip takes `__attribute__` alone: `int x __asm__("y")` still refuses, because
  dropping an asm name renames an object in silence. ⚠ what is skipped is DROPPED, so an
  `aligned` or `packed` ask on one MEMBER lays the member where its type says — the same
  silence the leading spelling has always kept (the alignment row below), and an ABI question
  rather than a missed optimization. A `packed` on the struct BODY is read, and stays read.
- `__label__ a, b;` at a block head parses and drops — a label already mangles to `fn.NAME`.
  ⚠ so a name DECLARED in two blocks of one function refuses (above) where gcc compiles it.

The whole set costs **+0.081% of the instructions** compiling src/love.c (perf, 136.115G vs
136.005G, the same tree built twice and stable to eight figures). `pprim` sees every identifier
in the TU, so the four arms' string compares hide behind `bib?` — a length test and one
character. Without it the same features cost +0.128%, which is what the shape test is for.

**`_Generic` and `_Alignof` landed 2026-08-14** (test/cc/136-c11.c, held to gcc). `_Generic`
picks on the controlling expression's lvalue-converted type (`pdecay`) and lowers to the
selected arm alone, so no other arm reaches gen — a call to an undefined function in one links
clean. `_Alignof` answers `talign`, the door `playout` lays members with, so the operator
cannot drift from the layout it describes; gcc's `__alignof__` rides the same lane and keeps
its expression operand. Association matching is structural over the type, and as of
2026-08-16 that type carries **qualifiers** — the row below.

Four of them carry an edge worth knowing:

- **`_Alignas`** is honored at **file scope only**, on the one door gcc's
  `__attribute__((aligned(N)))` already used (`alignat?` → `ps 'aligns` → `cgdata`); both the
  constant and the type-name operand (`_Alignas(double)`) work, and the `.o`'s section header
  asks the linker for the same boundary. ⚠ on a **local or a struct member it is still
  skipped in silence** — the row below.

- **variable-length arrays** ride x64, arm64 and riscv64; the thumb family says `no lane
  for a variable-length array on <tgt>`. ⚠ a VLA with an *initializer* refuses everywhere
  (`parse error near =`) — C's own rule, not a gap. `__builtin_alloca` is absent on every
  target, so a VLA is the only dynamic frame allocation here.
- **wide and prefixed literals** desugar to a *bounded compound literal* of the element type
  (`L` → wchar, `u` → char16 with surrogate pairs, `U` → char32, `u8` stays bytes), so globals,
  locals, braces, elision, concatenation across a prefix and `sizeof` all match gcc on every
  target, and a wide *char* constant decodes to its last code point as gcc reads it. ⚠ the
  storage is the compound literal's — automatic inside a function where C says static duration,
  so a pointer kept past the frame dangles, and `wchar_t *p = L"x"` at file scope refuses on the
  static-clit row above. A mixed-prefix concatenation `u"a" U"b"` takes the first prefix where
  gcc refuses.
- **`__extension__`** is a no-op at a declaration's head (file scope, block, member, before
  `typedef`) and as a cast-expression prefix, the typedef declarator's trailing attribute run
  skipping alongside — which is what opens `#include <pthread.h>`. gcc-refused spots like
  `int __extension__ x;` still refuse; ⚠ `sizeof(__extension__ T)` is accepted where gcc
  refuses, the one tolerance.
- **universal character names landed 2026-08-14** in every literal face
  (test/cc/138-ucn.c). ⚠ a UCN names a CODE POINT, not a byte, and that is the whole
  trap: `"\u00E4"` in a **narrow** string is the two utf-8 bytes `C3 A4`, where
  `"\xE4"` is the one byte `E4` — so `escseq` reports whether the escape was a UCN
  and the narrow lane encodes on that. Exactly 4 (or 8) hex digits: a short run refuses
  rather than taking what it found, matching gcc's *incomplete universal character name*.
  C11 6.4.3p2's **validity rule** is enforced: a UCN may not name a basic-set character
  (under `00A0`, bar `$ @ ` `), a surrogate, or anything past the last code point — so
  `\u0041` for `A` refuses. ⚠ that rule was found by the **cross** gcc (13.2), which
  refuses it where the newer host gcc takes C23's relaxation and says nothing: a
  single-oracle check would have shipped the hole. ⚠ we also refuse past-`10FFFF` where
  gcc only warns — a refusal, so it costs no right answer.
  ⚠ an identifier spelled with one still refuses — the row above.

### the directives, and which are ignored on purpose

`#pragma`, `#ident`, `#sccs`, `#assert`, `#unassert`, a bare `#` (the null directive,
C11 6.10.7) and gcc `-E`'s `# 42 "f.c"` line marker all pass and do nothing — except
**`#pragma push_macro("X")` / `pop_macro("X")`**, which save and restore the definition
(gcc's semantics: a per-name stack, a saved-undefined pops back to undefined, a pop with
nothing saved is a no-op, and the directive body reads raw so a user macro named `pop_macro`
cannot interfere — cts 00206). `#warning` says its
text and continues. **Everything else refuses** (C11 6.10p1) — the catch-all that used to ignore
an unknown directive let `#cmakedefine X 1` sail through, so an unconfigured template header
compiled clean and the name it owed was simply absent.

**`#line` MOVES the line number** as of 2026-08-14 — `__LINE__` and every later diagnostic
report the mapped line, matching gcc (test/cc/137-line.c). The delta rides `macs`, the one
state already threaded through every arm of `cppgo`, so no signature moved; it is applied
where active tokens accumulate, and again on a directive's own body, which is what makes
`#if __LINE__` right. `doinc` saves and restores it, so a header's `#line` does not follow the
return. The operand is **macro-expanded** when it is not already a digit sequence (C11
6.10.4p3, landed 2026-08-17), so `#line line` takes the 1000 that `line` expands to and a
second round works too; one that still is not a number leaves the directive doing nothing.
⚠ the **file operand is parsed and dropped**: `#line 700 "generated.y"` reports line
700 of the *real* path, where gcc says `generated.y`. `__FILE__` is the TU's name throughout
(cpp shares one macro table across includes), so the file half wants that lifted first.

⚠ `#include_next` refuses *because* it is unimplemented — ignoring it drops a header in silence,
which is worse. carries when it becomes load-bearing.

### the predefine surface

The gcc-shaped `<stdint>`/`<limits>`/`<float.h>` family **landed 2026-08-09** — `moon.l`'s
`stddefs`, one table forked once on the word width plus the wchar ABI fork, ~165 rows riding
the driver's `-D` channel (cpp stays target-blind): the `__INTn_TYPE__`/`__UINTn_C`/`*_MAX__`/
`*_WIDTH__` ladders, `__SIZE_TYPE__`/`__PTRDIFF_TYPE__`/`__INTPTR_TYPE__`/`__INTMAX_TYPE__`,
`__WCHAR_TYPE__`/`__WINT_TYPE__`, `__BYTE_ORDER__` and the `__ORDER_*` trio, `__CHAR_BIT__`,
the `__SIZEOF_*__` set, `__LP64__`/`_LP64` (c-testsuite 00212), and the full `__FLT_*`/
`__DBL_*`/`__LDBL_*` trait sets. Every value is gcc's own spelling on that target (verified by
stringize-diff against `gcc -dM -E` on x64/riscv64/arm-none-eabi and clang's aarch64), and
`__LONG_MAX__` moved out of cpp into the fork, so t32 now answers `0x7fffffffL` instead of the
64-bit lie. On top of the older rows: `__STDC__`, `__STDC_HOSTED__`, `__mooncc__`, the linux/
unix spellings, the arch pairs, `__INT_MAX__`, `__FLT_MAX__`/`__DBL_MAX__`,
`__SIZEOF_INT128__` on x64, `bool`/`true`/`false`. Pinned by test/cc/123-predef.c (all four
compilers agree at 21) and the t32 `#if` checker run against arm-none-eabi-gcc.

Three deliberate deviations, all in the compiler's favor of honesty:
- `__CHAR_UNSIGNED__` stays **out** everywhere — gcc's arm/riscv char is unsigned, ours is
  signed on every target, and a predefine describes *this* compiler.
- the `__LDBL_*` rows answer **double's** values — no `long double` here, so a consumer takes
  its double lane, the one we can compile (`__DECIMAL_DIG__` is 17, not x87's 21).
- `__SIZEOF_INT128__` stays **x64-only** where real gcc also defines it on aarch64/riscv64 —
  only gen's x64 lane carries d128, and claiming it elsewhere invites code we refuse.

**C11's conditional-feature macros landed 2026-08-14** (`featdefs`, moon.l; the gate sweeps all
six targets). Saying an absence out loud is what makes it *conforming* rather than a hole, and
it lets a portable source take its other lane instead of hitting a parse error:
`__STDC_NO_ATOMICS__` and `__STDC_NO_THREADS__` everywhere, `__STDC_NO_COMPLEX__` off x64,
`__STDC_NO_VLA__` off x64/arm64 — each row tracking the parity table below, because claiming an
absence we do not have sends a consumer down a fallback for nothing. `__STDC_UTF_16__` and
`__STDC_UTF_32__` are the positive twins: `u""` is UTF-16 and `U""` UTF-32, which is exactly
what those two assert.

A user `-D` lands after the table and wins. What remains absent is the exotic tail: the
`__FLT16/32/64/128*` extended-float families, `__CHAR16/32_TYPE__`, decimal floats — nothing
in the userland ladder reads them yet.

Landing the table also made **`__LINE__` true**: the `-D` text used to skew it by its line
count (nothing compensated). `clexat` now stamps the prepended lines `1-k..0` so the TU's own
numbering starts at 1, and moon.l's `deskew` pay-back pass retired with the skew. `#line`
moves it too now (the directive section above).

### `_Generic` over qualified types — landed 2026-08-16

Two C rules pull opposite ways here, and mooncc had neither: the controlling expression is
**lvalue-converted** (DR 481), so its *top-level* const or volatile is gone before any row is
tried, while everything *inside* a pointer survives and compatibility is exact. So `const int x`
picks `int:`, and `const char *` and `char *` are two different rows. Ours dropped every
qualifier, matched the first structurally equal row, and answered whichever one was written
first — c-testsuite 00219 (`const int * const` taking the `int *` row where C takes neither and
falls to `default`) is off the roster with this.

⚠ **the type language still carries no qualifier**, and that is the point: a node for one would
reach all 56 of gen's ptr dispatch sites. The one consumer that must tell `const char *` from
`char *` keeps its **own marked copy** — `('cq mask t)` over the leaf, mask 1=const 2=volatile —
parked in `ps 'qtys` beside `'locals` and shadowed with it, staged by each declarator parse
(`ps 'qstage`) and consumed by the bind that follows. Nothing outside `_Generic` reads a marked
type, and a stage is taken only when it strips back to the type actually bound, so a mark cannot
outlive the declaration that described it. The sources of a mark are the specifier run
(`qrun`), a typedef's own (`ps 'qtdef`), a struct member's (`ps 'qmem`, which `playout` has no
slot for), and — for a cast, whose `('cast ty ..)` node keeps the bare type gen reads — a
re-read of the type-name off the tokens (`qctl`).

It costs **+0.09% of the instructions** compiling src/love.c (perf, 130.348G vs 130.231G,
stable to five figures across runs), and the `.o` is byte-identical. Two things buy that back and both are load-bearing: nothing is staged for
an unqualified declaration (the common path never touches a table), and `qrun` walks the
specifier run rather than taking a token span — a span by `tally` is O(the rest of the stream),
which would have been quadratic over a TU.

Held to gcc by test/cc/143-genericqual.c: 31 checks over locals, params, block scope, globals,
typedefs, members, array decay, `&` and `*`, and const told apart from volatile.

Two deliberate readings:

- a type-name with a **top-level** qualifier (`int * const:`) is parsed, kept, and matched
  against nothing — no lvalue-converted controlling type can be compatible with it. gcc accepts
  the row and never selects it; clang warns. We agree on the answer and say nothing.
- ⚠ only the **specifier run's** qualifier is seen. A mid-declarator one — `char * const *p`,
  where the const sits on the inner pointer — reads unqualified, so it matches *more* than C
  does, never less. `typedef char *cp; const cp x;` is read right (a const *pointer*, so the
  mark does not reach the leaf); `typedef char *cp; const cp *y;` is the shape that would not be.

⚠ one path binds a name without staging for it: a **K&R** parameter list, whose types arrive as
separate declarations. A prototype's staged mark for the same name would still be sitting there,
and it is taken if it strips back to the same type — so `int f(const char *buf);` followed by a
K&R `f(buf) char *buf;` would read `buf` as qualified. The guard makes it need a shape match as
well as a name match; nothing in the tree or the corpus reaches it.

### the `_Static_assert` quirks

- ⚠ **A failed static assert reports as `parse error near ;`.** The refusal is correct; the
  wording names the compiler's position rather than the program's fault. See.
- **`cfold` is deliberately partial** (no floats, no comma, no address constants) and `pstatic`
  **lets a non-constant assertion by**. Making non-foldable an error would convert every
  remaining fold gap into a hard failure across the userland ladder for no gain. Tightening it
  wants its own risk budget — instrument which real-world asserts fall through first.
- Accepted deviation: the ternary folds the **selected arm only** (C11 6.6), so
  `int a[1 ? 4 : x]` is accepted where gcc rejects it as variably-modified. Folding both arms
  is not merely stricter, it is *unsound* here — the divide guard answers "not constant" for
  `b = 0`, so `_Static_assert(1 ? 0 : 1/0, "boom")` would be let by. C11 6.6p3 gives `&&`/`||`
  the same latitude; short-circuiting them closes marginally more of the let-by hole, and is
  worth taking only if a consumer wants it.

---

## accepted, and WRONG — the rows that cost a right answer

A refusal is cheap; these are not. Everything here compiles clean and hands back the wrong
value, so nothing announces them but a differential — which is why they arrive in batches,
each batch behind an outside package or an outside corpus
rather than behind a test we thought to write.

### an enum constant declared in a BLOCK escaped it — FIXED 2026-08-17

C11 6.2.1p7 gives a block-scope enum constant the block's scope. `'enums` is one flat table and
nothing took a constant back off at the closing brace, so `enum { N = 4 };` inside one function
answered in every later one. Each constant now rides `ps 'enumacc` as a shadow entry from the
moment `pbty` pins it, and `edrain` moves the run onto the block's own shadow list — where
`unshadow` already knew how to put a name back, and where a local of the same spelling stacks
on top of it. ⚠ **file scope drains nowhere**: `note` clears the run per top-level form instead,
which is also what keeps the delta short enough for `edrain` to count by `tally`.

⚠ the constant is folded AT PARSE, and that is the whole reason a restore is sound here — no
`'enums` name reaches gen, so nothing outlives the table. A block-scope struct TAG is the same
C rule and **cannot** be done this way: the tag table rides out to gen and the type node carries
only the name, so pulling an inner tag would leave gen sizing `('struct T)` off the outer one.
That row renames instead — the section below.

Held by test/cc/147-enumscope.c, 11 checks against gcc: the escape itself, nesting, a block
constant over a file-scope one, a local over a block constant, the typedef arm, a tagged enum
with a declarator, and two sequential blocks.

### `##` with an empty operand ATE the token after it — FIXED 2026-08-17

C11 6.10.3.3p2 replaces an argument with no preprocessing tokens by a **placemarker**: it
pastes to whatever it meets, two of them paste to another, and the leftovers are deleted before
the rescan. There was no such token here, so `paste` (cpp.l) only folded a `##` that had a
following token, and an empty operand fell through two ways:

- `A ## B` with `B` empty emitted a **literal `##`** into the C stream — `parse error near ##`,
  loud and harmless.
- `A ## B ; bob` pasted `A` with the **`;`**, and since `jim;` does not relex to one token the
  fold kept `A` and **dropped the semicolon**. ⚠ that is a preprocessor silently deleting a
  token, and it reads as a refusal only because a missing `;` usually breaks the parse next.
  Nothing guarantees it does.

`subst` mints a `'pmark` token where a `##`-adjacent parameter has an empty argument (the
variadic tail included), `paste` folds it — `pm ## x` → `x`, `x ## pm` → `x`, `pm ## pm` → `pm`
— and a sweep drops any that met no `##`, so one can never escape into the C stream. Held to
gcc by test/cc/149-paste.c, 10 checks over an empty right operand, an empty left, both empty, a
three-way paste with an empty middle, the variadic tail, and tokens on either side of the paste.

### a block-scope struct tag collided with the file-scope one — FIXED 2026-08-17

C11 6.7.2.3 gives a tag defined inside a block that block's scope. `stag` was keyed by the
spelling alone, so the LAST `struct T` in a TU laid out every earlier one's members, and both
halves of that cost a right answer: an inner tag escaped (`sizeof(struct T)` in a later function
read the inner layout — c-testsuite 00044), and a collision refused as `cannot compile 'f'
(cause unnamed)` once gen went looking for a member the winning layout did not have (00053).
⚠ the ledger had this filed as a refusal row; the escape half was a **wrong answer** and nothing
said so. Both are off the corpus roster now, on all three targets.

A block tag takes a **key of its own** (`ptagkey`) and `ps 'tags` binds the spelling to it for
the rest of the block, riding the same shadow list the enum constants do. Renaming, not
retiring: the key is what the type node carries and what gen sizes and lays members by, long
after the brace closed, so the table only ever grows and it is the binding that retires. The
key is bound *before* the body parses, so `struct T { struct T *n; }` resolves to itself.
`'utag` and `'qmem` follow the key for free — they are pinned with it.

Three deliberate readings:

- ⚠ the key leads with `.` (`.T.3`), like `panon`'s `.anon0`, so it is **not a C identifier**
  and clay gripes rather than laying a name no C compiler could read back. A block containing a
  tag definition is *inexpressible* in clay's partition, which is the honest answer and not a
  red — a block tag cannot be said at top level without its block.
- ⚠ **a bare `struct T` with no tag in scope answers the bare spelling**, where C11 6.7.2.3p8
  declares a fresh incomplete tag in the current scope. So `struct Node *p;` in a body still
  means the file-scope `Node` it was written to mean. That accepts more than C spells, never
  less, and it is what lets the reference site stay a lookup instead of a lookahead to tell a
  declaration from a reference.
- an **enum** tag scopes by restoring, not renaming: `enum` lowers to `'int`/`'uint` at parse,
  so no enum tag key ever reaches gen. Only its signedness is scoped, and `'etag` rides the
  shadow list beside the constants.

Held to gcc by test/cc/148-tagscope.c, 14 checks: the escape, two colliding blocks with a member
access in each (the part gen resolves late), the file-scope tag still itself, a self-referential
inner tag, nesting, a union tag, a block typedef over a block tag, a forward reference, and two
sequential blocks.

### a declarator was not in scope for the initializers after it — FIXED 2026-08-16

C11 6.2.1p7: a declarator's scope begins at the **end of its declarator**, so
`unsigned long M = f(), N = g(), n = M * N;` must read the local `N`. mooncc bound the
declaration's names only after the whole declaration was parsed (the block loop's `shadowdecl`),
so an earlier declarator was invisible to a later initializer and any file-scope enum constant or
typedef of the same spelling won. Now `'declaring` marks each name as its declarator finishes and
the primary rule declines to fold it; the block's `shadowdecl` still owns the durable hiding and
the restore. ⚠ found by a DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN OUR OWN TWO BINARIES — `love` is mooncc-built and
`love0` is gcc-built, and running the same array battery under both named the one function that
differed. That instrument costs nothing and nobody had pointed it at the tray ops.

### from an outside corpus

`test_cts` holds c-testsuite's 220 programs to the output they ship (doc/misc/moon.md). Its roster is
**refusals only**, each loud and named — no program in the corpus compiles clean and answers
wrong on any of the three targets. 212 answer on x64 and 8 refuse (9 on arm64, 10 on riscv64,
the target rows below). `roster_wrong` stays in the gate, empty, because the day one comes back
it belongs there and `wrong` is the kind that must stay loud.

⚠ **A rostered line is a claim that goes stale in silence.** Four of them (`#if ||`'s dead arm,
`int x[const *]`, a function-typed parameter, `_Generic`) had been fixed by earlier rungs and
still sat on the roster; 00219's line said *refuses* where the truth was *answers wrong*; and
00044's said the tag *escapes to file scope* as if that were the refusal it sat under, where the
escape compiled clean and answered wrong. Every one of those is a gate that only runs on an
opt-in corpus describing a compiler that had moved. Re-read the roster when the corpus is in
hand, not only when a gate goes red.

### the residues the fixed rows left behind

Each of these rode in behind a row that has since landed, and each is still a real divergence
from gcc that nothing announces. None has found a consumer yet — which is why they sit here
rather than in a commit.

- **unary `+` vanishes at parse** (it exists only to promote), so `sizeof(+c)` is 1 where gcc
  says 4; and `sizeof(a = b)` still defers to gen's 8, the assignment wearing its unpromoted
  left type.
- **a bool param past the 6th, or one named in a variadic list**, binds straight to caller
  memory — no store, so no arrival conversion, and a wild caller value reads back raw.
- **a mooncc caller into a gcc-built bool-param callee** hands over the bare int where SysV
  promises 0/1; the entry `cvt` covers mooncc callees only.
- **`(bool)` of a pair/i128 value** tests the low word alone.
- **the VLA lane's runtime `dim * sizeof(elt)`** still multiplies bare (the dim is the runtime
  side), and **`offsetof` still folds signed** where every other `sizeof` wears the unsigned
  coat.

### an alignment ask on a LOCAL or a MEMBER is dropped in silence

`_Alignas(64) char buf[8];` inside a function, and `__attribute__((aligned(N)))` on a local or
a struct member, compile clean and align nothing — `alignat?` runs from `ptop` only, so it
never sees a block-scope or member declaration, and `pquals` balance-skips the tokens on the
way past. The classic use is the one that breaks: a 16-byte-aligned buffer for an SSE load.

Costing the fix: the frame side is small — `nslot` is the one cell allocator and the offsets
are its own arithmetic, so an aligned variant is a `aup` on the running high-water, and x64/
AAPCS64 hand every frame a 16-aligned base, which covers every ask up to 16. What is not small
is **threading the ask from parse to that allocator**: the align would ride the `('decl ..)`
entry, and every positional consumer of a decl entry in `gen.l` moves with it — the same shape
of cost `asm goto`'s surface row carries. Past 16 the frame must be realigned at run time, and
that should refuse rather than land wrong.

⚠ Until it lands the tree cannot use either spelling on a local, and neither can a header it
compiles — and since 2026-08-18 that covers the TRAILING spellings on a local, a parameter and a
member too, which skip alongside the leading one rather than refusing. A struct **member** is a
second rung: `playout` computes a member's alignment from its type alone, and an over-aligned
member also moves the tag's own alignment (`asalign`'s 16+-guard, gen.l, is written for exactly
that day).

### what the %f hunt actually found — and the trap in it

⚠ **`printf("%f", 1.23e12)` answering `9AB0000000000.000000` under a mooncc-built PDCLib is
NOT a miscompile.** PDCLib's `_PDCLIB_print_fp` indexes `_PDCLIB_digits[ buffer[i] ]` over a
buffer that `_PDCLIB_print_fp_deci` filled with *characters*, so it reads ~12 bytes past a
37-byte array — undefined behaviour, in their source, on every compiler. It looks right under
gcc for one reason: gcc aligns that `.rodata` to 16, landing `_PDCLIB_Xdigits` at exactly
`_PDCLIB_digits + 48`, and `Xdigits` opens `"0123456789"` — so `digits['0' + d]` reads
`Xdigits[d]`, the correct character. mooncc aligns to 8, `Xdigits` lands at +40, and every
digit shifts by eight.

The lesson is the comparison, not the bug: **a gcc-built copy of the same library is the
control, and glibc is not**. Diffing against glibc's `printf` says only "these two libraries
disagree". A real defect was under it — the duplicated lvalue of `++*current++`, one character
wide (doc/misc/moon.md, `calm?`) — and only visible once both builds ran the *same* patched source.

Same build, same file family, still open: `strtod("-0.000123e+6")` does not answer -123.0.

### an `l` suffix — landed 2026-08-16, the `f`-suffix row's twin

C11 6.4.4.1 makes an `l`/`L`-suffixed constant a **long**; ours typed it by magnitude alone, so
on the 64-bit targets `sizeof(1L)` answered 4 and `i + 2L` computed in **int** — a silent
narrowing of exactly the expression written to avoid one. `ukind` now answers a distinct `'lnum`
and pprim lowers it to `('cast long ..)`; `1LL` off t32 took the same lane, where it had been
falling through to a plain int as well. c-testsuite 00219 is what named it, two lines apart.

### an `f` suffix, and A CAST TO float — both landed 2026-08-14

Two bugs wearing one symptom, and the second was the real one. C11 6.4.4.2 makes an
`f`-suffixed constant a **float**; ours kept 53 bits, so `sizeof(1.5f)` was 8 and
`0.1f == 0.1` was **true**. The lexer now answers a distinct `'flof` kind (the suffix was
being skipped and thrown away) and parse lowers it to `('cast float ..)`.

That fixed the *type* and not the *value*, which exposed the one underneath:

⚠ **a cast to `float` never rounded.** gen keeps every float as a double in a register and
narrows only at a **store** (`fstf`), so the cast lane's `(flo? tgt)` arm passed the value
straight through — `(float)d == d` read true for an ordinary double **variable**, not just
for a literal. The cast now round-trips `cvtsd2ss`/`cvtss2sd`, which is where the rounding
becomes observable; both ops were already in the vocabulary and all six targets take it.

Held by test/cc/140-fsuffix.c. The old note here said the consumer was PDCLib's `INFINITY`
spelled `(_PDCLIB_FLT_MAX * 2)` — ⚠ that reading was wrong twice over: PDCLib is not this
tree's libc (`crew/moon/lib/nolibc/` is), and we do not define `INFINITY` at all. The real
consumer is every `float` expression in the tree.

### the `#if` evaluator — LANDED 2026-08-14, and one of its three bugs cost right answers

`#if` arithmetic is intmax_t/uintmax_t (C11 6.10.1), so a value is a 64-bit **bit pattern plus
a signedness** — `(v u)`, v in `[0,2^64)`. Love's integers are exact and unbounded, which is
why none of this fell out for free. Three separate wrongs lived here, and the first is the one
worth remembering:

- ⚠ **truth was `0 <`, where C is `!= 0`** — so `#if -1` read **false**, and so did
  `#if -1 && 1`, `#if -1 ? 1 : 0`, while `#if !(-1)` read true. Any header branching on a
  negative constant took the wrong arm in silence. This was not in the ledger; the signedness
  row is what led to it.
- **no signedness at all**, so `1UL - 2` answered -1 where C wraps it to a huge unsigned, and
  `-1 < 1U` read true where C reads false.
- **`&`, `|`, `^` answered nothing on a big.** love's bit ops stop at the fixnum and every
  pattern past 2^62 is a big, so `#if (0xffffffffffffffffUL & 0xff) == 0xff` was false.
  `cbit` splits into 32-bit limbs, operates, and recombines — arithmetic, which bigs do take.
  `<<`/`>>` had already routed around the same hole through multiply and divide.

Held to gcc by test/cc/139-ifexpr.c, seventeen conditions across truth, signedness, the
conversions, truncating division, arithmetic shift and the bitwise trio. ⚠ the one place gcc
still says more: it *warns* on signed overflow in a `#if` (`0x7fffffffffffffff + 1`); we wrap
silently and agree on the value.

⚠ **The constants live at the HEAD of cpp.l's top-level `:` and must stay there.** love0's
compiler is single-pass and folds a pure global at each definition's own compile, so one of
them bound mid-list reads as `;; missing m64` — and only in the **mooncc0** bake, which is
love0's lane. The default love takes it either way, so the edit looks clean and the build
fails two targets later.

## accepted in SILENCE — the constraints that get no diagnostic

C11 §4 asks for a diagnostic on every syntax-rule or constraint violation, and these get none.
They are worse than the refusals above and quieter than the wrong answers: the program is
ill-formed, we say nothing, and the damage lands somewhere else entirely. The row below, and
the int-for-pointer one that landed 2026-08-16, were both found by a **foreign cc compiling the
same file** — the only instrument that has ever caught one, and the reason a lane that builds
love with clang is worth keeping.

### a `musttail` into an incompatible prototype

An `__attribute__((musttail))` call must match its **caller's** prototype — same return type,
same parameter list. Our sibcall pass asks only whether a jump is *emittable*, so a caller
carrying an extra argument will happily jump into a callee without one:

```c
// a 5-arg caller into a 4-arg callee: mooncc emits the jump, clang refuses the compile
static struct ai *f(struct ai *g, union u *Ip, ai_word *Hp, ai_word *Sp, int extra) {
  ai_musttail return callee(g, Ip, Hp, Sp); }
```

clang: `cannot perform a tail call to function 'callee' because its signature is incompatible
with the calling function`. This is the one gap that undermines an invariant rather than a
value — `ai_musttail` is *owed*, and the whole discipline rests on a shape that cannot jump
REFUSING at compile (love.h). A check that passes the incompatible case means mooncc alone
cannot police it. Measured 2026-08-15: 58 converted `ghelp` tails, mooncc took all 58, clang
named the 5 that were extra-arg lvms.

⚠ **`make vmret` does not cover this.** It reads the shipped binary, which mooncc builds — so
it sounds mooncc's own output against mooncc's own rule. `test_front` is currently the only
gate compiling clang at `ai_tco=1`, which is what caught it.

---

## target asymmetries

Six targets: **x64, arm64, riscv64, thumb2, thumb2sp, thumb1**. The 32-bit ones carry most of
the live gaps, but not all of them — two lanes are x64-only. Everything here is a **loud scare,
never silent**.

| lane | amd64 | arm64 | rv64 | thumb2 | thumb2sp | thumb1 |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| `__int128` | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — |
| `_Complex` arithmetic | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — |
| variable-length array | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — | — |
| by-value composite arg, ≤16B, registers free | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — | — | — |
| by-value composite arg, MEMORY class | ✓ | — | — | — | — | — |

| 64-bit `*` and shifts | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | libgcc |
| `double`/`float` arithmetic | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | libgcc | libgcc |

**The table is generated, not maintained: `tools/moon-parity.sh table` prints it and
`tools/moon-parity.sh check` fails if this doc and the compiler have drifted** (`why` prints
each refusal's cause). Regenerate it rather than editing a cell by hand.

⚠ **A ✓ means the lane exists, not that it is differentiated** — the sweep compiles (`-c`) and
reads the object's symbols, and only x64/arm64/riscv64 have running gates behind them. ⚠ several of
these refusals arrive as `cannot compile 'f' (cause unnamed)` rather than a named cause —
`__int128` and every composite-argument row among them. The refusal is real either way; what is
missing is the sentence naming it.

⚠ **`libgcc` is a cell value, and the two targets wearing it borrow for different reasons.**
thumb1 (v6-M) has no UMULL, no long shifts and no FPU, so 64-bit `*`/shifts/divide, int↔double
conversion and *all* float and double arithmetic lower to `__aeabi_*` calls (`gen.l`'s `v6m?`
lanes); `port/rp2040/Makefile` names a cortex-m0 libgcc.a on the link line and calls it "the one
foreign FILE". thumb2sp borrows for one row only — it is ARMv7E-M with an **SP-only** FPU (the
Playdate's STM32F746), so `float` rides the hardware and `double` softens, where thumb2's
fpv5-d16 does both. A borrow is a LINK-time dependency, invisible to a compile: it shows up as
an undefined `__aeabi_*` in the object, which is how the table finds it. Everywhere else the
lane is ours or there is no lane.

⚠ **The two struct rows do not move together, and thumb1 inverts them.** v6-M returns *any*
struct over 4 bytes through memory (`sretm?`), so thumb1 takes both composite returns while
refusing every composite *argument*; arm64 and riscv64 are the mirror image, taking arguments
and the 16B return but refusing the MEMORY-class return — which is what stops PDCLib's dlmalloc
on the cross targets.

⚠ **The register-exhausted by-value composite is x64-only, and even there only the gp half.**
A 9..16B aggregate argument with too few *integer* registers left now goes wholly to the
overflow block on x64 (SysV's rule; the param side already bound it there, and the shape is
`xdrawcursor(int,int,Glyph,int,int,Glyph)` in st). ⚠ **The SSE twin still refuses**: five
`struct { float a,b,c; }` by value exhausts xmm0–7 and `cgfn` gives up — the same rule, the
other register file, and c-testsuite's 00204 is the probe.
**arm64, riscv64 and t32 refuse the gp case too** — deliberately, because each has a
*different* rule:
AAPCS64 closes the gp file behind a stack composite (C.13), riscv64 SPLITS one across the
register/stack seam, and t32 has no lane at all. Three rules, three rungs; do not fold them.

⚠ **A by-value composite NAMED in a variadic parameter list rides x64 and arm64** (`vaspill`,
`vaspill-a64`); `vaspill-rv` and `vaspill-t32` refuse the shape, each for its own ABI's reason.
⚠ that is a different shape from *passing* a composite at a variadic call site, which riscv64
also takes — probe the one you mean.

- **mixed/int-pair 8..16B composites on t32** — an aone-`int` 5..8B, or a two-eightbyte
  not-both-sse aggregate by value; register-exhausted stack HFAs (9+ double args); and
  doubles/pairs/structs across a t32 VARIADIC seam. love.c reaches none of them.
- **a 16B all-int composite RETURN on t32** refuses on thumb2 and thumb2sp; arm64, riscv64 and
  x64 all take it. ⚠ the probe must DEFINE one, not declare it —
  `typedef struct {int a,b,c,d;} R; static R mk(int x){ R r = {x,x,x,x}; return r; }` plus a
  caller; a bare prototype compiles everywhere. It is what stops the Playdate SDK's own
  header: `LCDMakeRect` returns an `LCDRect` by value, so `pd_api.h` cannot be compiled for the
  device — which is exactly why `port/playdate` routes it through `pdglue.c` on
  arm-none-eabi-gcc and calls that a "word-only seam". AAPCS32 wants the hidden-pointer memory
  return the v6-M lane already implements (`sretm?`); thumb2 has no such lane.
- **a MEMORY-class composite RETURN on arm64 and riscv64** — `no lane for returning this
  80-byte struct by value on <tgt>`. Probe: `typedef struct { long a[10]; } R;` with a
  definition that returns one; a bare prototype compiles everywhere.
- **signed 64-bit `/` and `%` on thumb2 and thumb2sp** refuse (`cgfn refuses`) — love.c's lane
  is unsigned; wrap the unsigned expansion in an abs/refix sleeve when needed. thumb1 answers
  it, but through libgcc's `__aeabi_ldivmod`.
- **thumb1 varargs** — the pop-pc epilogue cannot drop the r0-r3 block; `vaspill-t32` refuses
  v6-M whole.
- **thumb1 `leax`** — the indexed-call variant (`a[i]()` over a local array) hits
  `;; lea-range (r0 r4 8)`, the scaled-indexed-address gap.
- **`__builtin_bswap64` and the `__sync` spin-lock pair on t32** — `no lane for <name> on
  <tgt>`; bswap16/32 and clz/ctz ride every target (t32 clz is the CLZ word / `__clzsi2`,
  ctz the isolate-and-clz / `__ctzsi2`), but the 64-bit swap wants the r0:r1 pair lane and
  the atomics want LDREX/STREX plumbing (v6-M has none), and nothing reaches either there yet.

What **thumb2** carries, so it is not re-derived (thumb1 reaches libgcc for most of this — the
⚠ above): 64-bit `long long` as register pairs (lo:hi on r0:r1, r2:r3 the shuttle) with +, -,
×(UMULL/MLA), unsigned `/` and `%` (a self-contained 64-step restoring expansion — no
`__aeabi_uldivmod`, no libgcc), all shifts across the word
boundary, every relation (SUBS/SBCS, exact at the 2^53 tie), widen/narrow, `__builtin_clzll`,
pair args (AAPCS32 even-odd pairs, 8-aligned stack slots) and pair returns, pair
globals/locals/members/derefs. VFP doubles on thumb2 (fpv5-d16 scalar, f0..f15 → d0..d15, d15
the reserved converter scratch; VCMP+VMRS for NaN-honest flags), with `am.c` running
BIT-IDENTICAL to the host on the M7. By-value composites + varargs on thumb2 (a {double,double}
HFA rides d-pairs per the AAPCS32-VFP rule; va_list is gcc's one running pointer). `la` on
thumb2 lowers to the MOVW/MOVT absolute pair, and `leax` to `ADD.W Rd,Rn,Rm,LSL#n`.

⚠ **Parse-side and gen-side type twins drift silently.** `tsz`/`talign` (parse) and `(wsize g)`
(gen) once disagreed on pointer width, mislaying every struct containing a pointer on both
32-bit targets with no scare. The target is threaded into the parse state now (`psnew tgt`,
`psword ps`), but those two copies are still kept in step by hand. The promotion/conversion
law stopped being a twin 2026-08-09: `pprom`/`puac` (parse.l, the typing door) is the one
spelling, `ptype` and gen's `cmpu` both consume it, and the width rides one parameter
(`!(pst32? ps)` / `!(t32? g)`). Any NEW parse-side type computation should go through or
beside the door, not grow a private ladder.

⚠ **Parse folds early on purpose** — an array bound needs the constant at parse time, and gen's
`szof` lane is too late. Deferring a fold to gen is not an available fix.

---

## asm goto — what building it would cost

The one refusal that has been costed rather than just filed. Still **not built**: it is close to
kernel-only, and it is worth doing when something we actually want to compile demands it, and
not before. ⚠ the references below were accurate when written — re-check them at the point of
edit rather than trusting them.

**The allocator is not the problem.** The obvious fear, that a terminator with multiple
successors would break the tuned register allocator, does not apply: `hasasm` already disables
register homing for any function containing asm, the vmap flushes at every label, and `alive`
already answers the whole universe for both `goto` and `asm`. Keep homing off under `hasasm` and
the allocator needs no change at all.

The three real blockers:

- **The raw blob cannot name an outer label.** `cgasm` assembles the body immediately via
  `holo-bytes` with an empty pre-bound label table, so a label not defined inside the template
  hits `(scare 'undef-label ..)`. The hook is clean, though — raw is lowered verbatim by every
  backend (`x64.l`, `arm64.l`, `thumb2.l`, `thumb1.l`), and `chunk-len`/`resolve` already handle
  an inline `('fix w kind label aux)` anywhere in the stream, so a raw carrying an unresolved fix
  would lay out against the **outer** function's label table for free. What is missing is a holo
  door — a variant of `assemble-at` that assembles while leaving a whitelist of external labels
  as fix placeholders instead of scaring. `laylax` would treat such a fix as its widest form.
- **`cfoldir`'s pend merge is the one correctness hazard.** A label with no recorded pending
  state that is linearly live inherits the fall-through state verbatim, so an invisible in-edge —
  a branch out of an opaque raw blob into a C label — makes that join unsound: constants assumed
  at L would not hold on the asm edge. The minimum fix is to collect the asm-goto target labels
  per function into the `backs` table, so they take the existing assume-nothing path. Cheap, and
  it mirrors back-edge handling exactly, which exists for precisely this reason.
- **Surface.** `pasm` hardcodes three colons as `s1`/`s2`/`s3`; a fourth (GotoLabels) needs an
  `s4` and a fifth field on the `('asm ..)` node, which ripples to every positional consumer in
  `gen.l` and to the goldens in `law.l`. `asmsub` must learn `%lN` — currently `'bad` — and
  substitute the *mangled* label `fn.NAME`, sharing the mangling with the label emitter.
  `asm goto` is implicitly volatile and, pre-GCC-14, takes no outputs.

Everything else already refuses or resets on raw: `unframe` bails, `deadcell` dirties, `deaddef`
treats it as a barrier. **The estimate is about a week**, touching parse, one gen pass and one
new holo door — and not the allocator.

⚠ **It does not bring Linux into range on its own.** The kernel additionally wants `__label__`,
computed goto, `_Generic`, and attribute semantics that change codegen.

---


## external corpora

**c-testsuite is wired** — `test_cts`, `test_cts_arm64`, `test_cts_riscv` over
`test/gate/cts.sh` (doc/misc/moon.md). 220 single-file programs held to the output they ship, on all
three targets, ~60 s each, opt-in on `make dl/c-testsuite` and skipping whole without it. Its
first run is where twelve rows of the syntax ledger above and six of the wrong-answer rows came
from. The roster of failures lives in the gate with a cause apiece.

The rest are still recommendations. `test/cc/` holds 131 gcc-differentiated files, so the
harness exists; this is a corpus question, not an infrastructure one.

- **gcc.c-torture/execute** — ~1500 self-contained self-checking files (`abort()` on failure,
  `return 0` on pass). The de facto bar; tcc, chibicc, cproc and lacc all run it. Ships in the
  gcc source tarball, not installed here.
- **csmith** — random program generation for differential testing against gcc/clang; fits the
  differential-fuzz habit already in holo. Not installed.
- The commercial ANSI/ISO conformance suites (Plum Hall, Perennial ACVS, Solid Sands SuperTest)
  are not realistically obtainable. Noted so nobody goes looking twice.

Nearer real-world targets that exercise this surface without the Linux cliff: busybox, sqlite,
lua, zlib, musl — see.
