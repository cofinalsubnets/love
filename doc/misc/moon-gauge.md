# moon-gauge — what mooncc's codegen is measured against, and what residency is worth

## the target application is love itself

Codegen quality is gauged on **love**: `ccbench`'s corpus row, which builds the host binary
with each compiler and runs the arch-neutral test corpus through it. That workload is
love.c's VM — call- and branch-dense dispatch — and it is what mooncc exists to compile.

The cipher rows (chacha20, poly1305, `bench/ccrypto.l`) are **subsidiary**: a lever gauge,
not a target. chacha indexes a 16-word array in its inner loop and poly keeps five scalar
limbs, so the pair reads whether a gap is array slots or general residency. (It once read a
second signal too — chacha rotates 320 times a block, poly never — until gen.l learned the
rotate idiom, 2026-08-22: `ror4`/`rorv`/`rorv4` in holo's IR on x64 + a64, sha256
4.23× → 2.90× and chacha 5.80× → 3.59× on landing, every rotate-free row inside noise.
Both hypotheses had been true, each owning a row.) ⚠ do not read the pair to zero:
`src/core/love.c:6138`'s z-tray comparison is the same array-indexed shape.

⚠ **the corpus average is flattering and the pair exists because of it** (`ccbench.sh`'s
own header says so). Both rows, every time.

The **heavy-nif rows** (inflate, crc32, sha256 — `bench/cnifs.l`) are a third kind: not a
target and not a lever, but *work the tree waits on* — `love source` unpacks through
inflate and checks with crc32, every svalbard id is a sha256. They also span the pair's
shapes: crc32 carries no array across its loop, inflate is branches and a table, sha256
is a 64-word array beside eight scalars.

## the differentials (2026-09-06, x86-64, static musl on the native lanes)

One quiet `make -C bench ccbench` fill, the shipped artifact (the one-build world) on
the mooncc lane. ⚠ absolute ms are not comparable to older fills — the corpus grew
again; the RATIOS are the record. ⚠ the harness had answered dnf on every lane since
the src reorg (it spelled src/love.c and src/*.c); re-pointed this day, and a table of
dnf is the harness, never the compilers (`ccbench.sh` says so at its LIVE check).

| row | mooncc | gcc-musl | clang-musl | /gcc | /clang |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| build | 20,963.4 ms | 11,537.6 | 7,756.2 | 1.82× | 2.70× |
| corpus | 7,152.7 ms | 5,985.8 | 5,909.3 | **1.19×** | **1.21×** |
| chacha20 | 766.6 ms | 254.5 | 189.0 | 3.01× | 4.06× |
| poly1305 | 1,222.5 ms | 1,447.0 | 772.4 | **0.84×** | 1.58× |
| inflate | 91.3 ms | 54.7 | 83.3 | 1.67× | 1.10× |
| crc32 | 615.7 ms | 479.5 | 479.6 | 1.28× | 1.28× |
| sha256 | 771.2 ms | 340.3 | 359.5 | 2.27× | 2.15× |

Against the 2026-08-28 fill (this section's git history): poly1305 still beats gcc
(0.86× → 0.84×), sha256 tightened 2.58× → 2.27× and crc32 1.43× → 1.28×, the corpus
loosened a little (1.17× → 1.19× on gcc, 1.13× → 1.21× on clang). ⚠ **chacha20 widened,
2.42× → 3.01×** — mooncc's row rose 685 → 767 ms while gcc's fell 283 → 255, which is
past the ±4% cross-layout lottery on both sides; the array-slot lane moved the wrong way
between the two fills and is not chased here. clang's inflate row (57 → 83 ms) is the
other outlier, one lane moving alone — hold both readings lightly until a second fill.

## the same floors compiled STRAIGHT (ccnif, 2026-09-06)

`make -C bench ccnif` builds src/host/hash.c and src/core/gz.c with every lane
and reads them three ways — answers (a divergence is a miscompile, the only thing in the
script that says a compiler is *wrong*), .text, wall clock. No love runtime, no libc in
the loop; ~20 s, so it is the per-edit instrument where ccbench is the per-rung one.

| ms (median of 5) | mooncc | gcc -O2 | clang -O2 | gcc -O0 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| sha256 | 192 | 81 (2.37×) | 89 (2.16×) | 424 (0.45×) |
| md5 | 85 | 47 (1.81×) | 53 (1.60×) | 112 (0.76×) |
| crc32 | 17 | 13 (1.31×) | 14 (1.21×) | 25 (0.68×) |
| cksum | 18 | 14 (1.29×) | 14 (1.29×) | 25 (0.72×) |
| deflate | 197 | 138 (1.43×) | 131 (1.50×) | 334 (0.59×) |
| inflate | 25 | 19 (1.32×) | 16 (1.56×) | 46 (0.54×) |

(2026-09-06, the one-build world; the 2026-08-28 fill is this section's git history.)
mooncc beats gcc -O0 on every row. Against 08-28 the rows moved both ways and mostly
inside noise — sha256 2.52× → 2.37×, inflate 1.45× → 1.32×, md5 1.69× → 1.81×, deflate
1.36× → 1.43× — with no row past the lottery. .text whole-file (mooncc/gcc-O2/clang-O2):
hash.c 8,788/9,284/7,725 · gz.c 18,450/16,954/26,027 (deflate and inflate are one file
now) — **mooncc's hash.c is smaller than gcc -O2's, and its gz.c smaller than clang's**.

⚠ **only the whole-file .text number is a sound total** — gcc and clang inline statics out
of existence (hash.c is 45 functions under mooncc, 34 under gcc), so summing shared names
charges mooncc for a callee its opposite number paid for inside a caller. The script
prints per-function ratios instead, worst first; `sha_block` stays the widest cell (3.37×
clang's bytes beside the 3.03× clock — the static and dynamic readings name the same
function).

## the same floors on wasm: mooncc against emcc (ccwasm, 2026-09-06)

`make -C bench ccwasm` is ccnif's shape on the wasm target: the two nif drivers built by
`mooncc -t wasm` and by emcc (clang + musl, `-sMEMORY64` so long and pointers are ours),
every lane run by the same node, answers checked first. emcc is the one other compiler
that reaches the seat, so this is the wasm lowering's gauge the way gcc is x64's.

| ms (median of 5, 24 reps) | mooncc | emcc -O2 | emcc -O0 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| sha256 | 819 | 159 (5.15×) | 531 (1.54×) |
| md5 | 249 | 144 (1.73×) | 213 (1.17×) |
| crc32 | 67 | 52 (1.29×) | 64 (1.05×) |
| cksum | 68 | 48 (1.42×) | 65 (1.05×) |
| deflate | 628 | 218 (2.88×) | 421 (1.49×) |
| inflate | 107 | 68 (1.57×) | 99 (1.08×) |

Every lane answers the same bytes on every row. Read beside ccnif's native table: crc32,
cksum, md5 and inflate sit where they sit on x64 (1.3–1.7×), but **sha256 is 5.15× against
emcc -O2 where it is 2.37× against gcc, and deflate 2.88× against 1.43×** — the array-heavy
shapes lose twice over on wasm. The lane is gen's rv64 lowering laid as wasm locals, so
every array slot the native lane keeps in a register is a memory op through the shadow
stack here, and there is no register allocation to hide it; -O0 emcc, which also spills
everything, is the fairer floor and mooncc is 1.05–1.54× of it. That is the reading rung
5a and the optimisation rungs after it are measured against.

**The module is big.** sum.c is 186,189 bytes as our module against emcc -O2's 13,703
(13.6×) and gz.c 214,683 against 26,911 (8.0×): mooncc's text runs ~4× gcc's natively
(ccsize) and the link pulls nolibc members whole, so a driver that wants printf carries
the formatter's neighbours. A size rung, if one is wanted, starts at the archive's grain.

**The whole corpus, both builds under node** (the gate's own command, `test.mjs --love`):

| build | laws | corpus | wall | rss |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| mooncc, out/wasm/love.wasm (wasm64, tco=0) | 4765 | 42.2 s | 49.8 s | 2.8 GB |
| mooncc, the same at tco=1 (return_call; rung 5a, 2026-09-07) | 4765 | 32.1 s | 38.0 s | 2.8 GB |
| emcc -O2, out/wasm/love.js (wasm32, tco=0) | 4731 | 17.7 s | 20.8 s | 0.49 GB |

2.39× on the corpus on the trampoline, **1.81× with return_call** — between the corpus's
native 1.19× and sha256's 5.15×, as love.c is the call-dense VM and the ciphers are the
array floor. ⚠ not quite the same work: the emcc build is 32-bit (34 fewer laws run under
`word`), still trampolined, and its heap is a sixth of ours.

## where the build's ~18 s goes (measured 2026-08-22, before love.c split into seven TUs — the shape holds, the per-file split is finer now)

Direct per-step timing, not subtraction: `src/core/love.c` is 68% of the build, and 88% of
that one compile is codegen (`cgen-obj`) — lex+cpp+parse 10%, object write 2%. The perf
profile of the compile is flat VM dispatch (`lvm_argtwocond` 13%, `lvm_eq` 12%, `lvm_tapn`
8%, then the arg family; gcp 2.2%): no data structure to fix, no collector to tune — it is
gen.l's own love on the interpreter, ~1.6× gcc per unit. ⚠ the linker is 1% of the build
(194 ms vs ld's 38) and is not the problem. ⚠ the splice JIT is not the lever either and
its census said why before the code was cut (`lib/splice.l`, `-fir`, `dis`/`disg`,
removed 2026-08-13): 95.1% of the 12,427 closures reaching the door during a love.c
codegen contain a CALL, and the splicer deletes dispatch *between* the ops of one thread —
there is no machine form for "enter an arbitrary closure". gen.l is calls almost all the
way down; whatever pays its 11.5 s down, it is not that lane.

## what the residency layer is worth (2026-08-28, the one-build world)

`tools/moon-ablate.sh`, whole roster in one run, same-run base, quiet box. The roster is
the three surviving knobs — the fine-grained ones (lhome/homes/pcs and the old worlds)
retired with the dance, and the one build owns their work. The cost of ABLATING a
mechanism is what the mechanism buys:

| ablated | cycles | insns | .text |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ralloc (operand pool dry) | +2.7% | +7.2% | +2.0% |
| tpool (pool + all seats) | +1.8% | +14.0% | +6.1% |
| cs (callee-saved grants) | −2.4% | +1.1% | +2.7% |
| **tpool,cs (no residency)** | **+4.7%** | **+20.6%** | **+10.1%** |

⚠ read the INSNS column: each conf is a different binary, so the cycle column wears the
cross-layout lottery (±4% — the how-to-measure section), and cs's −2.4% cycles beside
+1.1% insns is that lottery, not a finding. What the table says against the old world's
(git history; +17.2% cycles / +23.0% insns for the whole layer then): the layer's
instruction price holds (+20.6%) while its measured cycle price fell — the one build's
seats sit where the old world's post-hoc mechanisms had to buy their way back in. The
pre-cut history (vmap and csbor deleted at ≤0, lhome/homes/pcs priced separately) is
this section's git history and the pare plan's rungs 2–5.

⚠ **the two halves have opposite economics, and it is the file's central finding**: the
pool/homes half buys cycles with instruction count (B: +15% insns for its cycles, IPC
rises as they arrive — store-to-load forwarding on L1-hot slot traffic is nearly free on
this core), the cs half buys latency at flat count (C: +2.8% insns for +8.6% cycles —
breaking the store→load chain across calls). An instrument that counts instructions ranks
them backwards; that is how "every landed lever is a size lever" was once recorded as a
disappointment.

Whole layer: **+17.2% corpus cycles** — mooncc's 1.21× corpus row would sit near ~1.42×
without it, so the layer closes about half of the remaining excess against clang. It is
not overhead.

## attribution (2026-08-23, Zen 3, Ryzen 7 5825U) — why instruction count is not the meter

Intel's `--topdown` does not apply; the Zen equivalents, corpus with boot subtracted:

| | base | D (no residency) |
|---|---:|---:|
| instructions | 32.55 G | 40.04 G |
| cycles | 10.91 G | 12.96 G |
| IPC | 2.98 | 3.09 |
| L1-icache misses | 261 K | 483 K |
| iTLB misses | 395 K | 425 K |
| uop queue empty | 1.60 G (14.6%) | 1.26 G (9.7%) |
| **load-queue token stall** | **14.7 M** | **133.4 M** |
| store-queue token stall | 3.0 M | 6.9 M |

The instruction column is near-deterministic (±0.01%) and tempting; the table is why it
misleads: icache and iTLB misses are noise against tens of billions of instructions, the
marginal (ablated-in) instructions retire at far above the baseline IPC, and what moves
when residency leaves is the load-queue stall — memory latency, not issue width. Cycles,
on both ccbench rows, for anything claiming a speed effect.

## landed levers (2026-08-23, kept as method)

Three finds from disassembly-first pricing — each names the evidence that funded it,
and together they are the method the forward path below inherits:

1. **inline const-prop — LANDED 2026-08-23 (the CONST bind).** An inlined body used to
   materialize every argument to a frame slot, constants included: sha_block's spliced
   `rr(x, k)` was 7 instructions + 4 frame ops per rotate riding `%cl` where gcc emits
   `ror $6`. A literal arg whose conversion to the param type folds exactly (cnum's
   arithmetic is the slot round-trip's) now substitutes into the body as
   `(cast pty (num v))` — no slot, no forms, every immediate lane reads it. Declines:
   body assigns or shadows the name, asm in the body, `&param` (through clval, the real
   call stands). sha256 230 → 204 ms (3.03× → 2.68× gcc); compression 139 → 121
   insns/iter, all counts immediate; corpus flat. What separates 2.68× from gcc now is
   the VALUE param's slot traffic and the zext chatter — lever 3's territory.
2. **adjacent store→reload, u32 lane — LANDED 2026-08-23.** cc_block stored an element
   and reloaded the same slot on the very next instruction 32 times; the `stld` adjacent
   lanes only matched full-width `st`/`ld`. The narrow pairs forward now, wearing the
   extension the load promised (`zx4`/`sx4` and kin), on any base — every anchor shape
   is a full `ld`, so only the full-width r4 pair stays reserved. A store fed by an
   adjacent `li` declines (that triple is the si fold's). chacha −2–4% cycles at flat
   instructions, interleaved same-run.
3. **u32 zext chatter — LANDED 2026-08-23 (`rezx`).** 96 of cc_block's 619 instructions
   were `mov %eax,%eax` re-asserting a cleanliness the producing op already guaranteed.
   `rezx` (after `copyprop` in the x64 sweep chain, stage-sigged `(a) a`) tracks each
   register's clean width — the zx family and unsigned loads by contract, the 32-bit
   rotates' w-form dests, an li's own value, a mov carrying its source's — and drops a
   zxN over a register already clean to N; any other def dirties, a bar clears. The
   required zexts (after 64-bit ALU) stand. cc_block 619 → 486 insns; sha256
   204 → **195 ms** (2.57× gcc), crc32 1.42× → 1.33×, cksum 1.38× → 1.23×; .text
   −8,192 B. "Free on Zen" was wrong — same-register 32-bit movs are not eliminated.
4. **chacha's residual is the valve's shape, not a gen.l rung.** cc_block's 16-word state
   gets zero residency: the element ops are load-op-store round trips. The mechanism that
   chased this (the vmap) priced negative and is deleted; the pare plan's answer is the
   flat.l valve — a hand kernel in holo's neutral IR, built on demand, not another
   thousand lines of gen.l.
5. **cfoldir's 64-bit knowns + fold table — LANDED 2026-08-28 (the SSA oracle's coda).**
   A known is the word's signed value now (love's fixnum is exactly s64, so the bit ops
   read straight and the arithmetic wraps), and the table covers what the oracle named:
   the immediate shifts and rotates (`ror4` low-32, `rol` as `ror W-k`), the unops (neg,
   not, the sx/zx family), xor, and a cmp decided by its cc's signedness. The fixnum tag
   `li 2; sx4; shl 1; or 1` is one li; LONG_MIN's three ops are one. The a64 lane prices
   an li by its movz/movk lanes (a fold answers a li up to two lanes, a copy of a known
   becomes its li only at one — x64's reg-reg mov vanishes at rename, the lea lesson, so
   there the mov stands). ⚠ the old arm for the unops and variable shifts invalidated
   r0–r3 instead of the op's own dest: `li r9 5; neg r9; add r0 r9 1` folded to `li r0 6`
   — a latent miscompile, reachable only once a non-r0 register carried a known into a
   unop; the table's exact folds retire it, and `imma` now gates x64's imul on imm32
   (a 2^40 known would have ridden the three-operand form). Priced: ccnif .text hash.c
   −48 B, deflate.c −478 B (−4.9%), inflate.c −54 B, every clock inside the band;
   the a64 battery 117,627 → 115,160 instructions (**−2.10%**, 132 of 153 programs
   changed). test_cts 212/220 and cts_a64 211/220 unchanged, fixpoint byte-identical.
6. **int-vacate — LANDED 2026-08-28.** Two verdict arms in `upar`: an int param in a64's
   r4 arrival rides free with its entry cvt, as a pointer does (`a4rider?` — the pool test
   had refused it), and a HOT int param that cannot ride (a quad under a dirty body)
   vacates to its positional seat, `mov` + cvt — hot by the blocker law (loop-weighted
   read count ≥ 64); a cold one keeps its slot, which is what the +3.4% refusal in git
   history was about. mag_mul's inner bound is register-register now: the exact meter
   reads mag_mul 92.16G → 91.60G (−558M) on the arm64check corpus, mag_add tighter by
   the same shape, 48 a64 fns changed; the whole-corpus total is flat (+0.005%) under the
   cross-binary walk drift (how-to-measure). x64: r6/r5/r7/r8 arrivals already rode, so
   the arm fires once in hash.c (+8 B), the corpus reads identical instructions
   (71.238G both worlds) and the x64 battery is byte-identical. Gates at reference.

7. **narrow homes + the precise crossing charge — LANDED 2026-08-28 (the attribution's
   first lever).** `lhomable?` admits bool/char/short (and their unsigned) under the same
   canonical-extension discipline as int: every def re-narrows through cvt, a bool's cvt
   converts (so the seat holds 0/1), reads are zero forms. Three refusals stood between
   the gate and lvm_eq's hot line, each found by dumping ulloc's verdicts for that fn:
   `bool r` is declared four times in sibling blocks and the universe refuses a
   multiply-declared name (alive's liveness is name-keyed) — a `respell` prepass ahead of
   kprop and alive now spells later decls apart (nm`2, nm`3; C block scoping, sdecls keep
   their label) — and the pool-seat rule's `crs = 0` charged `r` a crossing for the tail
   call whose *argument* it was, and `r`2` one for its own initializer's call. The
   charge is now precise at a statement's edges (`recx`: the wrapset stays the sound
   superset, the charged set drops a tail call's arguments and a single-call statement's
   born names); `skiprel` matches reg AND slot (a seat now serves several disjoint
   spans); and x64's seat file ranks a param's arrival register last — a seat at the
   arrival-aligned front evicted the untouched arrival the sweeps forward from (Ip's slot
   loads came back the first time). A bool in a quad arrival vacates rather than rides
   (its cvt defs through `set`, which qclob? cannot tell from a clobber). Priced: the
   a64 exact meter 1,507.87G → **1,496.89G (−0.73%)** on the arm64check corpus —
   mag_mul −5.6%, lvm_aq −46%, ai_big_canon −14%, ai_net −16%, lvm_eq −4.5%, nf_hash
   and shash −6%, hash_at −9%; the largest regression ai_big_to_flo +0.1G. x64 perf,
   interleaved before/after on the corpus: 74,286 → 73,238 samples (−1.4%), lvm_eq
   2,836 → 1,744 (−38%: the byte cell's store-forward round trip was the line); every
   other per-fn move is on a byte-identical body (the layout lottery). .text −1,119
   instructions (−0.8%). Gates green, the a128r law renamed its registers.

8. **the bool width in rezx — LANDED 2026-08-28.** A `set` (and an li of 0 or 1) leaves
   its register clean to width 1 — a bool — so the bool re-canonicalization `cmp r 0;
   set ne r` over it is the identity and drops (a mov carries the fact, any other def
   dirties it, and a flags read right after keeps the pair). lvm_eq's hot line is
   `cmp; sete; movzbq; test` now. Priced on the a64 exact meter, body-changed fns only
   (the corpus walk drifts between binaries — lvm_qa/lvm_aq moved ∓10G on identical
   bodies): lvm_cond −2.70G (−4.1%), lvm_eq −1.25G (−4.9%), lvm_nilp −0.54G, lvm_argcond
   −0.40G, ~−5G = −0.33% of the corpus; the total read −0.95% with the drift. x64 .text
   −143 instructions, lvm_eq 531 → 527.

9. **the copy fold once more after repack — LANDED 2026-08-28 (the G-load rows).** The
   GVN oracle's finding, taken literally: `copyprop → stld → copyprop → deaddef → deadst`
   runs again on the CHOSEN forms after repack, when the cs seats its chains minted exist
   (base still r4 there; every pass is stage-preserving, so the typed chain admits it
   ahead of coal). A slot copied through r0 from a fresh seat (a nested splice's param)
   now forwards from the seat, and the store it fed drops. ⚠ deadst after repack read the
   BUILD's object map while the forms spoke the packed layout — an lea's escape marked the
   wrong object and arr[2]'s store dropped (test/cc/69-float, 40 for 42; the bake
   segfaulted in ai_ini_0) — so repack re-pins `g 'slots` to the packed map (promoted and
   retired objects gone, the cs save slots added). ⚠ and the bisect that "proved" every
   subset safe was reading make's `grep Segmentation`, which the bake's own fallback
   swallows: judge a build by booting its love (`echo '(putx 42)' | LOVE_NO_IMAGE=1 love`)
   and by the test/cc battery through the bootstrap image, never by make's exit. Priced
   on the a64 exact meter, body-changed fns: lvm_link −8.1G (−7.0%), lvm_cur −5.6G
   (−2.1%), shash −3.3G (−23%), nf_hash −0.9G, evac_data −0.6G, gcp −0.44G, ai_big_binop
   −0.44G; corpus total 1,482.65G → **1,472.60G (−0.68%)** (lvm_qa's +10.6G is the walk
   drift flipping back). x64 .text −1,666 instructions (−1.16%): gcp 903 → 865, p0read1
   948 → 916. Two laws moved: repack's narrow-promotion laws take a fresh g each (the
   re-pin is a mutation), and wv's alias copy folds after repack.

## the path forward

**Codegen quality**, each lever with the evidence that prices it (largest first is not
the order — cheapest-instrument-first is):

1. **the x64 rung-6 residuals**, recorded in the moon-ssa ledger: the gcp-class
   path-frequency miss (~0.8% insns — the classifier's path maximum is static, and a
   cold-if fn whose hot path never calls still refuses rides), the dead-home-def sweep,
   the arg-seat aim declining onto armed homes, and the quad-vacate mov in tail fns.
2. **the rv64 sweep port** — riscv is the one ELF target whose CHOSEN ir is unswept;
   its rezx wants a producer table of its own (`rorw` SIGN-extends, the a64 table is
   wrong as-is). Priced by the exact meter, which rv64 now has.
3. **the flat.l valve** for the array-kernel shapes (chacha's 16-word state) — the
   standing answer whenever a shape cannot be closed without another thousand lines.

**Internal design**, the questions the cut left open:

- **sweeps inside the arm build?** The post-choice seam was held by the deleted
  rankers; only the fp-settling reason remains. Moving the a64 sweeps in-build would
  simplify the pipeline to ONE sweep seam — priced by the exact meter, expect near-zero.
- **alive's numbering discipline — answered NO (2026-08-28).** A tablet keys
  STRUCTURALLY (`(pin t '(x 1) 7)` is found by a second `'(x 1)`), so the statement node
  cannot key the livtab: two `i++;` in one fn would share a wrapset. `id?` is the identity,
  but an identity-keyed list is O(n) a lookup, n² a fn. The tick and its guard stay.
- **repack's chains beyond x64** — a64/rv64 get tailst's straight-line peel but not the
  per-def promotion; the exact meter prices whether the general chains pay there. ⚠ not a
  flip: repack declines the whole arm family at its head (`arm? g`) because its frame
  model is x64's (`pro4?`, the `sub sp sp K` at form 3) — the price is the port.
- **the wasm relooper** (doc/misc/plan/moon-wasm.md) — its own plan; the one build
  removed nothing it needs and the residency story it must NOT pay for is now one
  mechanism instead of five.

## the a64 lane rides the sweeps (2026-08-23)

The sweep chain reaches a64 — at the POST-CHOICE seam (before deadlab), not inside
build. The seam was chosen because the old world's rankers priced ir1 as built and an
in-build sweep starved them; the rankers are deleted now (the cut rung), so the seam is
held by its second reason — the frame base is settled fp there (pre-a4ize an r4 is also
the 5th argument) — and "sweeps inside the arm build" is an OPEN internal-design
question, priced by the exact meter whenever someone wants it. On x64 the sweeps stay
inside build.

What moved: the passes took the target (`cfoldir g` / `stld g` / `addrfold g`), the frame
base is `(fbase g)` (fp past a4ize — pre-a4ize an r4 is also the 5th argument, so the
base laws only hold after the retarget), the epilogue anchors are `csregs` (`stldkp`),
`deadcell`'s path-exit pops are fp/lr, and the imm-form folds ask `imma` (the fold face
of `immok`: a64 add/sub ±16M, cmp ±4095, logicals bottom-aligned masks, mul never).
`cmpfuse` and the `si` fold stay home — no memory-operand compare and no store-immediate
off x64. The epilogue's `(lea sp fp 0)` is teardown, not an address take (stld/deadst).

Priced by count — on fixed-width a64 count IS bytes, and on in-order cores it is
close to cycles: the 150-program battery's .text −28,672 B (**−2.76%**), 131/150
programs changed, riscv byte-identical (still unswept — its lane needs its own rezx
producer table: `rorw` sign-extends). Gates: cca64 150, cts_a64 211/220, fixpoint,
test_slow, and a cross-seeded `love-a64` bakes and runs `love cc` under qemu.

## the SSA question, measured (2026-08-27)

Would an SSA middle pay? The four bespoke passes -- cfoldir, alive, repack's
promotion, deadst -- were measured against an SSA-grade oracle: dump every TU's
FINAL forms (doc/misc/proto/ssagap/, 82 TUs, 1102 fns, 133k forms), rebuild the
CFG outside the compiler, and run constant/liveness analyses to a real fixpoint.
Whatever the oracle still finds in shipped forms is what the passes missed.
Every count is a floor (unmodeled ops invalidate), and every category was
spot-verified in the forms before it was written down.

| residual fact              | static | loop-wt | in cfoldir's domain | + 64-bit knowns |
|----------------------------|-------:|--------:|--------------------:|----------------:|
| const slot reload          |    215 |   4,632 |                 143 |             179 |
| foldable ALU on knowns     |    476 |   4,886 |                 284 |             476 |
| mov of a known (li-able)   |    410 |   2,468 |                 375 |             405 |
| decidable branch           |      4 |      32 |                   4 |               4 |
| dead store                 |      2 |       9 |                   — |               — |

The reading, and it is not the expected one:

- **deadst and the branch folder are complete.** Two dead stores and four
  decidable branches in the whole corpus. (A first run reported 1,045 dead
  stores; every one but two was an outgoing-arg frame before a call -- check the
  instrument before the compiler.)
- **almost nothing needs SSA.** 100% of the foldable ALU and 99% of the movs
  fall to a LINEAR pass with 64-bit knowns -- cfoldir's own shape. The gaps are
  its fold TABLE (shl/shr/sar/not/neg/ror are blunt: `li 2; sx4; shl 1; or 1`
  ships as four ops where the fixnum tag 5 is one li -- ev.c alone carries 149)
  and its kmax cap (`li 0x7fffffffffffffff; neg; sub 1` materializes LONG_MIN in
  three ops; img_wake reloads a 2^40 constant in a loop cfoldir cannot hold).
  The fixpoint-only residue is ~36 const reloads corpus-wide.
- **the one structural miss is promotion's convex hull.** The mem2reg census
  (non-escaped fns, direct-touch cells only): 1,327 cells live across a call
  (spill class -- cs-seat territory, not headroom), but **1,954 full-word cells
  whose touch span is call-free** still ride the frame (9.9k loop-wt touches;
  dtb_to_kboot stores a pointer once and reloads it three times in fifteen
  straight-line forms), plus 254 narrow/si cells (11.2k loop-wt) the full-word
  law excludes outright. The bar is the window: repack widens the packing hull
  over every backedge, and a call anywhere in the hull fails every seat by
  construction -- so a fifteen-form chain inside a big loop inherits the whole
  loop's window. Per-DEF ranges (each store-to-loads chain its own interval) are
  the SSA idea worth having; nothing else here needs the phi apparatus.

So the priced answer to "generate SSA?" was no -- widen cfoldir's fold table
and knowns to 64 bits (linear, in-place, no new pass), and teach promotion
per-def windows instead of the convex hull. **The second lever is LANDED**: the
SSA arc's rungs 1-3 gave repack per-def chains (full-word, narrow, and cs
seats), and the arc went on to replace the whole two-build dance with the one
build (doc/misc/plan/moon-ssa.md, closed 2026-08-28). The first lever --
cfoldir's 64-bit knowns and fold table -- landed the same day (landed lever 5).

## the GVN/LICM question, measured (2026-08-28)

The same method as the SSA question, for the two passes that would actually need
phis: `doc/misc/proto/ssagap/gvn.tpl.l` (love, riding val.l's CFG) value-numbers
every fn's FINAL forms to a fixpoint over the CFG (a join keeps only what every edge
agrees on) and counts computations whose value already sits in a register (G), and
walks each back-edge span for loop-invariant computations in SSA's view -- every read
either unwritten in the span or reaching from an invariant def, register reuse
ignored (L). 86 TUs, floors throughout; LINEAR = every label starts empty.

| residual                    | static | loop-wt | linear (in-block) |
|-----------------------------|-------:|--------:|------------------:|
| G load (slot reload, value in a reg) | 1,540 | 15,092 | 995 / 11,796 |
| G alu (repeated ALU/shift/unop)      |   270 |  2,482 | 223 / 2,239 |
| G addr (repeated lea/leax)           |    61 |  3,624 |  54 / 3,596 |
| L alu (invariant ALU in a loop)      |   210 |  5,264 | -- |
| L addr (invariant address)           |    91 |  3,248 | -- |
| L load (invariant load, store-free loop) | 72 | 1,808 | -- |
| L li (a constant materialized in a loop) | 515 | 15,376 | (free on x64: no lever) |

The reading: **the CFG buys little** -- 78% of the redundant loads' loop weight and
~90% of the ALU/addr rows are in-block, a linear pass's territory. The shipped forms
still carry `mov r0 r11; st sp 136 r0; … ld r5 sp 136`, and cfoldir's input for
p0read1 says why (2026-08-28): the inliner materializes a nested splice's params slot
to slot through r0 (`ld r0 [g]; st [g2] r0; … ld r0 [g2]; st [g3] r0`), and cfoldir's
lattice names only constants and copies-of-a-register -- a loaded unknown has no
name, so the record "g2 holds a copy of r0" dies the moment r0 is reused two forms
later. The registers that would make those loads movs (g and d promoted to cs seats
r11/r12 by repack's chains) do not exist yet when cfoldir runs: repack sits
post-choice, cfoldir in the build. So the fix is not a phi and not a wider lattice:
run the copy fold once more AFTER repack (base still r4 there), or let repack's
promotion rewrite the slot copies it just made redundant -- priced by this oracle's G
load row, whole corpus 1,540 static. (The first is landed lever 9.) What genuinely needs
the loop structure is L alu + L addr + L load: ~370 forms, ~10k loop-wt -- twice the
ALU-fold residue that funded lever 5, spread thin (io.c's p0skip, inflate's
inf_run/inf_build, snap's img_hashcons head the lists). Spot-verified in the forms:
`and r10 r6 -8` under a loop head with r6 unwritten in the span; `imul r0 r5 8`
likewise. Neither needs SSA either: a span-local invariance pass over the flat forms
is the same shape as this oracle.

## where the corpus gap sits (2026-08-28, per symbol)

The target row read directly: `doc/misc/proto/ccattr/` -- perf cycles on the corpus
under the mooncc-built and gcc-musl-built love (ccbench's own lanes, static musl both),
three interleaved runs each, per-symbol samples. 13,743 vs 11,753 samples (1.169×, the
ccbench row); inlining differences hold 1.0%/0.6% of samples, so the ratios are sound.

| symbol | mooncc | gcc | excess | ratio |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| lvm_cur | 1,353 | 902 | +451 | 1.50× |
| lvm_eq | 860 | 419 | +441 | 2.05× |
| am_dgmul | 267 | 77 | +190 | 3.47× |
| lvm_unc | 676 | 515 | +161 | 1.31× |
| lvm_tapn | 580 | 432 | +148 | 1.34× |
| gcp | 529 | 408 | +121 | 1.30× |
| lvm_qap | 326 | 227 | +99 | 1.44× |
| lvm_argcap | 402 | 311 | +91 | 1.29× |
| lvm_ret | 396 | 312 | +84 | 1.27× |
| map_probe | 290 | 219 | +71 | 1.32× |

**The top ten hold 93% of the whole excess** (+1,857 of +1,990), and two functions hold
45%. mooncc wins some (lvm_argcup 0.69×, lvm_link 0.39×, lvm_argap 0.84×). The shapes,
from the disassemblies side by side:

- **lvm_eq 2.05×**: its hottest line (30% of the fn) is `movzbq (%rsp),%rax; test` -- the
  `bool r` local lives in a CELL (`bool` is not lhomable; only int/uint/long/ptr are), so
  the eq bit is stored as a byte and reloaded on the musttail path. Around it the bool
  re-canonicalizes (`sete; movzbq; test; setne; movzbq`) though a `set` is already 0/1
  -- a clean-width fact rezx does not track. The tag tests reload the object's head word
  and re-materialize `la lvm_sym` four times where gcc holds them (the oracle's G-load
  rows, live). Every exit reloads Sp/Ip/Hp from frame slots and restores r12/r13
  before the `jmpq *%rax`; gcc's hot path is register moves.
- **lvm_cur 1.50× (70 insns vs 38)**: four dead constant materializations at entry
  (`li r9 1; li r0 0; li r0 1; li r13 4`), the GC bound computed as `r13=4; +2; ×8; +0x40`
  where gcc has `lea 0x70(%rdx)`, a frame with two cs saves/restores that gcc's
  register-only version never needs.
- **am_dgmul 3.47×** (the decimal digit loop, 84 vs 56 insns): the one non-VM row.

So the gap is not dispatch density and not the residency layer: it is frame and
cs traffic on musttail exits, byte-wide locals kept in cells, repeated tag loads and
address rematerialization, and constant folds lost across seats -- all in ten functions.
The levers this names, cheapest first: ~~bool/char locals homable under the canonical-ext
discipline (lvm_eq's hottest line)~~ — landed lever 7, lvm_eq −38% on this instrument
(and ⚠ the instrument's lesson: re-run it before/after on the SAME binary pair and check
the body identity of every moved symbol — a byte-identical fn moving ±10% is the layout
lottery, not the lever); ~~a clean-width fact for `set` results in rezx~~ (lever 8: the line is
`cmp; sete; movzbq; test` now); ~~the post-repack copy fold (the G-load rows)~~ (lever 9:
−0.68% on the meter, lvm_cur −2.1%); a look at why lvm_cur's entry constants
survive deaddef and cfoldir. Each is priced by re-running this attribution on the two
functions it names, then the corpus row.

## how to measure

- `make -C bench ccnif` per gen.l edit (~20 s, no runtime in the loop); one quiet
  `make -C bench ccbench` fill per rung. Both cipher rows and the corpus, never one row.
- **the exact meter (a64/rv64)**: a ~40-line qemu TCG plugin (doc/misc/proto/insnpc/)
  counts guest instructions per translation block (inline adds into chunked scoreboards; PC→symbol through nm and
  the PIE bias from `qemu_plugin_entry_code()`), deterministic to ~5ppm — no cycles
  lottery, no sampling skid. `LOVE_NO_IMAGE=1 qemu-<arch> -plugin insnpc.so love <
  corpus.l`, per-world binaries via `MOON_ABLATE=... make xa=<arch> out/x-<arch>/love`
  (⚠ `love seed ARCH` drops the env; ⚠ rm the x-dir between worlds — env changes touch
  no mtimes). It refused the first a64 flip that forms and .text had approved, and its
  per-symbol attribution put the whole regression in two functions. ⚠ pin the TREE
  STATE: a binary built before a merge wears different semantics, and the mask it wears
  is a miscompile's. ⚠ across two BINARIES the corpus walks differently (address-keyed
  tables, unsorted keys): lvm_qa read +2.2G with byte-identical code, so a per-symbol
  delta counts only beside a mnemonic diff of that symbol, and the whole total wears
  the same drift. ⚠ a whole-artifact byte or .text compare can never close across a
  source edit (the carried source moves every address) — diff disassembly MNEMONICS and
  expect only the address-formers to move.
- ⚠ ±4% is the floor on a ccbench wall-clock ratio, and **cross-fill clocks lie past it**:
  a row moved +12% against the previous day's fill with byte-identical machine code, and
  crc32 (untouched by the change) moved +4.5% the same way. When a cut's rows move, diff
  the FUNCTIONS before believing the clock; instruction identity is the instrument.
- `sh tools/moon-ablate.sh [samples] [conf ..]` prices mechanisms: each configuration
  recompiles all of love under `MOON_ABLATE`, must close `test_fixpoint` (a configuration
  that cannot rebuild itself never reaches the timer), then perf cycles + insns + .text
  against the base row. Corpus by REDIRECT, boot subtracted, medians.
- ⚠ the ±0.7% cycle floor is a **same-run** property. Identical binary pairs read 1.5%
  apart across runs hours apart on a quiet box; same-day is not same-run. The harness's
  whole-roster-in-one-run design is the instrument, not a convenience.
- ⚠ **corpus cycles across DIFFERENT layouts carry a frontend-layout LOTTERY, observed
  to ±4%.** Function entries are 2-aligned by law (parity is the image codec's pointer
  discriminator, and 16-alignment was measured and REVERTED at ~4% slower — gen.l's
  fn-start note), so any size change reshuffles every downstream entry and deals a new
  branch-predictor and op-cache hand: binaries whose hot functions are
  instruction-identical have read +2.4% and +3.7% corpus cycles on branch-misses,
  icache and uop-queue-empty alone. Before believing a cross-binary delta of that
  size, check instructions (near-deterministic), hot-function identity, and the
  frontend counters — and read the rows the change actually touches through a direct
  driver (the ciphers moved −5% cycles in the same build whose corpus read +3.7%).
  Census rows inside the band (homes, pcs) are lottery-sized; the big payers stand.
- ⚠ **a row priced under another mechanism's veto is not that mechanism's price**: pcs
  read −0.4% while the cs borrow's `wb` denied it beside every callish loop, and +1.1%
  once the borrow was cut. When mechanisms gate each other, ablate the gater first.
- ⚠ an ablation is part of the compiler's IDENTITY: `mcid` carries `MOON_ABLATE` in the
  runtime-cache key (the nolibc archive under `out/cache/moon` once served
  base-compiled members into an ablated build — a "broken" fixpoint whose only defect
  was the env-blind key). Any future config knob must join the key the same way.
- ⚠ the mooncc ccbench lane races the ARTIFACT (its baked image keys as `"<baked>"`, so
  the archive cache survives intermediate rebuilds); a stale bake reads as a slow egg
  boot, never a wrong compiler.
- ⚠ holo's static binaries pad .text to the page (the section ends where .rodata's page
  begins), so a battery's .text total moves in 4,096 B steps and reads a 208 B fn as
  −4 KiB or as nothing. Count instructions (`llvm-objdump -d | wc -l`), not section bytes.
- ⚠ `src/apps/moon/law.l` goldens pin register identities and residency counts; a lane change
  churns them. That is not breakage — `test_cts` and the fixpoint are the behavioural
  instruments.
- Cycles, not instructions, for any speed claim on this box (the attribution above); on
  thumb1/2 and in-order riscv, count is the meter and `tpool` is already empty there.
