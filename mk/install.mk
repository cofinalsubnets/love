# is the BINARY and the things a person reads -- man pages and the vim files. ⚠ nothing
# else needs to: the loader resolves modules out of the baked image (the modules arc,
# rung 3) and mooncc carries its own headers and runtime (the bare cc door), so a nest
# holding copies of either would be serving nobody.
