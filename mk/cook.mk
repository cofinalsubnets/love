# mk/cook.mk -- a make-shaped front door to cook (src/apps/cook/cook.l over this tree's Makefile).
# `make -f mk/cook.mk <goal>` makes sure the love binary exists, then hands the goal to cook.
#
# The real Makefile stays the source of truth for the irreducible C bootstrap: cook RUNS on
# love, so it cannot build love. That one rung is make's, cook ports everything above it,
# and anything cook cannot drive -- qemu, a tty repl, a sub-make, perf, since cook's `run`
# captures stdout and waits -- passes straight through to make below.

LOVE := out/love
# ⚠ cook reads the Makefile ITSELF, never a transpiled snapshot: a snapshot freezes the
# $(wildcard) lists at emit time, so it goes quietly stale the next time a source lands.
