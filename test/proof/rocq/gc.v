(* test/proof/rocq/gc.v -- the generational MINOR is SOUND: under a complete write barrier,
   no live young object is lost. the minor's PAUSE has its shape: its work is
   bounded by the nursery alone, and tenured growth that keeps no young pointer
   leaves its survivor set identical (minor_work_bounded / minor_flat -- the
   theorems test/host/gcpause.l's gauge instance-checks). and the COPY LOOP has
   its shape: the Cheney drain terminates, copies each reachable object exactly
   once, exactly the reachable ones, and is a true fixpoint -- a second pass
   copies nothing (the drain_* theorems at the bottom; love.c's AiGcCheck
   build instance-checks the fixpoint on every minor, gate test_gcheck).

   This is the Coq counterpart of the runnable ai model of the
   nursery+old collector. That model's load-bearing self-check is assert (3b): an
   old->young edge recorded WITHOUT the remembered-set entry lets a minor wrongly
   reap a live young object -- it reproduces, by construction, the exact bug a
   missing write barrier is. spec.l DEMONSTRATES; this file PROVES: the barrier is
   not just necessary on one example but sufficient in general -- if every old->young
   edge is remembered, the minor's nursery scan reaches every young object the
   mutator can reach (`barrier_sound`), so a young object the minor loses witnesses
   an INCOMPLETE barrier (`minor_loses_only_if_barrier_incomplete`, 3b's converse).

   The same split the rest of the tree uses: prove the MODEL here, keep the C
   connected by the differential oracle (the corpus runs byte-identical with the
   minor firing) and by gen_audit (0 unremembered edges across the corpus, the
   empirical form of rem_complete). A proof that love.c's pointer code REFINES this
   model is the larger separate effort flags.

   Universe-checked Rocq: the world does not explode here (cf. spec.v's preamble),
   so the theorems are unconditional.
