/* C11 6.2.1p7 -- a declarator's scope begins at the END OF ITS DECLARATOR, so the
 * initializers that follow it in the SAME declaration already see it. 78-enumshadow.c
 * covers the block case (a local hides an enum constant for the rest of its block);
 * this covers the declaration itself, which is a separate scope point and was the one
 * that broke: `unsigned long M = f(), N = g(), n = M * N;` folded N to the enum
 * constant and compiled `n = M * 4`. core/love.c has `enum { N = 4 }` in one function
 * and N as a local in another, so lvm_outer's outer product wrote 4*M of its M*N
 * elements and handed back a tray with uninitialized heap in the tail.
 *
 * Every check contributes 1, so the exit code IS the number that passed. */
