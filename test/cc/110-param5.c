/* the 5th integer parameter is a POINTER, not the frame.
 *
 * 106-param4's a64 sibling, and a different fault under the same lane. gen
 * speaks r4 for the frame base on every target, and a4ize retargets it to fp
 * at the end of build BY POSITION: an r4 sitting in a memory op's BASE slot
 * becomes fp, an r4 anywhere else is left alone. On AArch64 gp 4 arrives in
 * x4 -- so the moment the ride analysis lets the 5th parameter stay in its
 * arrival register, and the body uses it the way a pointer is used, its base
 * slot reads as the frame pointer. `*p`, `p[i]` and `p + i` all addressed the
 * FRAME instead of p.
 *
 * ⚠ silent, and it answers rather than faults: fp is a valid address, so the
 * load lands in the caller's own frame and returns plausible garbage. Lua 5.4
 * found it -- lstrlib's prepstate takes six parameters, its 6th spilled and
 * its 5th rode x4, so ms->p_end came out as sp + lp and EVERY pattern match
 * silently returned nil. string.match, string.gsub and string.find with a
 * pattern were all dead in an interpreter that otherwise ran its whole test
 * battery, printed floats correctly and ran coroutines through setjmp.
 *
 * x64 cannot reach it (r4 is rbp, never an argument register) and neither can
 * thumb (4 arg registers) or riscv (nhome = 0, so nothing rides) -- which is
 * why 110 programs and the whole love corpus under mooncc/a64 stayed green.
 *
 * The register pressure is load-bearing, exactly as in 106: the 6th parameter
 * must exist and be live, or the 5th never rides and the fault does not
 * appear. Keep all six.
 *
 * Each check contributes 1, so the exit code IS the number that passed. */
