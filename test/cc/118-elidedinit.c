/* an elided initializer fills whole ELEMENTS, and an implied [] bound counts those.
 *
 * The bound divided the item count by the element's scalar LEAVES, which only an
 * array element type can answer -- so a struct element got one item apiece and
 * `PT cases[] = { 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, 8,9,10,11,12,13,14 };` over a seven-member PT
 * sized to 14 where C says 2 (c-testsuite's 00205). The bytes were laid right and
 * only the length was wrong, which is the half every loop over the table reads.
 *
 * Leaf-counting cannot say the rule (C 6.7.9p20). A union takes ONE initializer,
 * for its first member; a bitfield member takes one; and a char array takes one
 * item when that item is a STRING -- which the array lane was missing too, so a
 * plain string table `char m[][8] = {"ab","cd","ef"}` sized to a single row.
 *
 * Every check contributes 1, so the exit code IS the number that passed. */
