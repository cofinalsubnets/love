/* C11 6.10.3.3 -- ## with an EMPTY operand. An argument with no preprocessing tokens
 * becomes a placemarker: it pastes to whatever it meets, two of them paste to another,
 * and every one left over is deleted before the result is rescanned.
 *
 * Ours had no placemarker, so an empty operand left the ## unfolded. `A ## B` with B
 * empty emitted a literal ## into the C stream, and `A ## B ; bob` pasted A with the
 * `;` -- a join that cannot relex, which kept A and ATE the semicolon. The macros with
 * tokens on either side of the paste are the ones that hold that second half.
 *
 * Every check contributes 1, so the exit code IS the number that passed. */
