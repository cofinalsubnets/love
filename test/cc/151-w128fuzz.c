/* the wide pair under a RANDOMIZED differential -- 111-int128 walks the lane's
 * surface with one check each, which pins the shapes and not the arithmetic.
 * these two lanes are hand-built per backend rather than transcribed from a
 * hardware instruction, so they are the ones a stated example can agree with
 * and a random one cannot:
 *
 *   - the u128/u64 divide. x86 has divq and answers in two steps; a64 has
 *     no wide divide at all and rides 64 restoring steps, where the doubled
 *     remainder's carry-out is a case an example rarely reaches (it needs a
 *     divisor past 2^63).
 *   - the shifts by a REGISTER count, where a shift reads its count mod 64 and
 *     the answer for counts 0, 64 and 127 is built rather than executed.
 *
 * so: a fixed seed, 20000 rounds, every operation folded into one hash, and the
 * hash printed. the battery compares stdout, so a single disagreeing bit in any
 * of ~600000 operations moves the one line this prints. the division algebra is
 * asserted inline as well, which names the lane when it is the one that broke.
 *
 * refused off the d128 targets (ccarch.sh expects that, like 111-int128). */
