/* the 4th integer parameter survives its own function body.
 *
 * on x64 the SysV argument registers are rdi rsi rdx rcx r8 r9, and mooncc's
 * home pool is positionally arg-aligned at every position BUT two: arg 3 (rdx)
 * homes to r9 and arg 4 (rcx) to r10, so those two alone need a real prologue
 * mov. the ride analysis may instead let such a param stay in its arrival
 * register -- but it decided that by reading pass 1, where every param sits in
 * a frame slot, and then licensed a REBUILD that allocates differently. pass 2
 * reached for rcx as a store's address shuttle and the 4th parameter was gone;
 * the two out-pointers collapsed onto one, so `*d` wrote through `c`.
 *
 * ⚠ this is a SILENT wrong answer before it is ever a crash: with both stores
 * aimed at the same valid address nothing faults, one variable just never gets
 * written. it reached the shipping binary through am.c's mul64, whose `lo`
 * out-pointer became a wild address -- am_sin then segfaulted for every
 * |x| >= 2^19, i.e. `(sine 1e20)` in out/love, under a green test_slow.
 *
 * found by the am.c ulp differential (test_ulp), which is the only thing in
 * the tree that had ever compared mooncc's float output against another
 * compiler's. it lives HERE because it is a codegen law about parameters and
 * has nothing to do with math.
 *
 * the register pressure is load-bearing: with a short body the allocator never
 * wants the arrival register and the fault does not appear. keep the temps. */
