# test/gate/drv.sh -- the cc-DRIVER conventions gate: `CC=mooncc` must drive a
# gcc-shaped recipe unchanged. Three laws, each cheap:
#   1. the advisory flag soup (the REAL $(ai_cflags), passed in by make) rides
#      through -c and the link ignored;
#   2. a link owing libc symbols pulls the runtime BY NEED -- moonlibc + the am
#      math + the sys leaf, compiled from the sources beside us -- and the
#      binary RUNS;
#   3. the loud edges stay loud: -shared refuses (usage, exit 2) and -nostdlib
#      leaves the libc out (exit 1) -- an ignored SEMANTIC flag would be the
#      silent-no-op trap wearing a cc face, and this gate keeps that door shut.
#      And -nostdlib's refusal is pinned by its SENTENCE, not just its exit
#      code: it used to arrive as `;; link-undef "printf"`, a love debug note
#      escaping from inside holo, and an exit-code-only check is exactly what
#      let that stand for as long as it did.
#
# usage: drv.sh OUTDIR CFLAGS..
