# test/gate/ccarch.sh -- the C battery on a CROSS TARGET: every test/cc/*.c built
# by `mooncc -t <arch>`, run under qemu-user, and required to answer exactly what
# the same source answers on x86-64. TWO targets, ONE procedure (raw.sh's shape).
#
# WHY, and why the ORACLE is x86-64 rather than gcc. test_moon has run this battery
# against gcc -O0 since the driver was born, but only ever natively, and its own
# comment said "x86-64 only until a64 parity" -- so for four of the five backends
# the differential did not exist. That gap is not incidental: mooncc's targets share
# the whole front end and most of gen.l, which is exactly the arrangement where a
# fault in the SHARED model is masked on one target by a lane the other lacks.
#
# The first a64 run proved it. `(x * 0x076be629) >> 27` on an `unsigned int` x --
# test/cc/104-u32wrap.c's own de Bruijn ctz, the musl mallocng shape -- did not wrap
# to 32 bits. The faulty rule was shared by every target (a bare literal's value
# tuple is typed 'long, and u32bin? disqualifies on a long operand); x64 was right
# only because it has a mul-IMMEDIATE lane that passes 'int by hand, and a64,
# having no such form, fell to the register lane and read the 'long. One rule, two
# targets, and only the second told the truth.
#
# So the reference is THE X86-64 BUILD OF THE SAME SOURCE, which test_moon already
# pins against gcc. The two gates compose into a complete argument: gcc pins x64,
# and x64 pins every other target. That also makes this gate work where no cross
# gcc exists at all -- rv64 has qemu here but no cross toolchain, and asking
# "do my targets agree?" needs no third compiler. Where a cross gcc IS available
# (a64, via AARCH64_CC or the local Nerves toolchain) it is used as an
# ADDITIONAL oracle, because agreeing with x64 cannot catch a bug both share.
#
# ⚠ stdout is compared, not just the exit code. These programs return a COUNT of
# passing checks; eight bits can say THAT something moved and never which one.
#
# THE EXCLUSIONS ARE ASSERTED, NOT SKIPPED, and the list is PER TARGET. A program
# using a feature this target has no lane for must be REFUSED: nonzero exit, no
# signal, a diagnostic naming the file. A silent skip list is where a regression
# hides; and the day a target grows one of these its build starts succeeding, this
# check fails, and the name comes off that target's list -- which is exactly how
# 101-vla left a64's (the lane was one `and` mask and three sp moves away from
# neutral, and the C99 VLA has ridden both backends since).
#
# Skips whole (exit 0, a note) without the target's qemu -- like test_raw_a64 /
# test_rv64. make owns the dependency graph; this owns the procedure.
# NOT set -e: the checks report their own failures with context.
