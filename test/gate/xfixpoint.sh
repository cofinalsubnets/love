# test/gate/xfixpoint.sh -- the CROSS-MACHINE fixpoint, in effigy (doc/misc/plan/
# seed-universal.md U0). the x-lane's twin objects -- this machine's mooncc,
# -t the other arch -- link love1: machine A's bytes for machine B. Then love1
# itself, under qemu-user standing in for machine B, bakes its own mooncc
# image, rebuilds every TU natively (mooncc's default target is the ground it
# stands on -- no -t below, an a64 machine would pass none), links love2,
# and love1 must equal love2 TO THE BYTE. One cmp says two things at once:
# the twin machine reproduces this machine's bytes (what "same fixpoint
# everywhere" asks for), and mooncc's output does not depend on the arch
# mooncc runs on.
#
# ⚠ the TU flags MIRROR the Makefile's x-lane (AiHaveVersionH on love.o), the
# fixpoint.sh drift trap wearing its cross face. this gate's first run caught the
# version flag MISSING from the x-lane: the twin named itself "unknown".
# ⚠ AND THE LIST IS THE ARTIFACT'S, kernel objects included: a gate that links a
# shorter binary than `make` does still answers love1 == love2, and answers it
# about a binary nobody ships.
