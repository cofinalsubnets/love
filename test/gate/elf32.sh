# e_entry in Thumb state, and the process must print its line and leave with 42.

# NOTHING FOREIGN WRITES A BYTE: no as, no ld, no libc, no arm-none-eabi at all -- qemu-arm
# is an emulated cpu, not a toolchain. That is the point of the lane, and the reason it runs
# on boxes where test_thumb1/2 skip.
