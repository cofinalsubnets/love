# test/gate/targz.sh -- src/apps/tar/tar.l + src/apps/gz/gz.l against the two programs they replace.
#
# test/host/gz.l proves the laws that need nothing outside the tree: crc32 against
# its published vector, both coders against each other, the ustar header field by
# field. THIS gate proves the half that only the outside world can say -- that GNU
# tar and GNU gzip AGREE with us, in both directions, over a real tree.
#
# ⚠ AGREEING WITH OURSELVES PROVES NOTHING HERE. A coder and a decoder written by
# one hand share a model, and a round trip through both is green for any pair of
# functions that invert each other -- including a pair that agree on a format
# nobody else speaks. The system tools are the only oracle that can catch that,
# which is why this gate exists separately rather than as more asserts.
#
# The tree is chosen for what it puts in the header rather than for size: a
# SYMLINK (typeflag 2, and a target in the linkname field), a file with a MODE
# that is not the default (0600), an EMPTY file, a file whose size is an exact
# multiple of 512 (so the body padding is zero bytes -- the off-by-one lives
# there), a deep path, and incompressible bytes beside compressible ones.
#
# Skips cleanly where either tool is missing, and takes the love binary as $1.
