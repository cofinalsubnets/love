# test/gate/bakerep.sh -- A BAKE IS A FUNCTION OF THE TREE, not of the machine.
#
# Two bakes of one binary must be the same bytes, so a release can be checked by its
# hash and two people can agree they have the same artifact. Everything that ever broke
# this wrote the BAKER's environment into the image instead of the tree's content:
#
#   the kept absolutes  a binary pointer stored as the address it happened to have,
#                       +delta'd on load -- correct, and it carried the ASLR base
#   the header pair     `anchor`/`refsym`, two ADDRESSES compared only to check their
#                       deltas agreed, which is their GAP being preserved
#   a reverted husk     the glaze redirects a native cell to its interp twin and leaves
#                       the husk as ballast; its W^X pointer rode into the image, from a
#                       mapping whose distance to the binary is randomized
#   `born`              the hatch DURATION, frozen from whichever machine baked
#
# ⚠ SECONDS, AND IT RIDES THE SLOW GATE ON PURPOSE. test_distboot proves the whole
# circle -- the artifact rebuilding itself to the byte -- but it is opt-in and minutes
# long, so a regression here would sit unnoticed until a release. This is the same law
# asked cheaply enough to run every time.
#
# ⚠ THE PATH IS NOT IN THE IMAGE, though this line once said it was and gave that as the
# reason the two bakes share a path. `love-image` is the literal "<baked>" wherever the
# binary carries its own .image section (src/host/main.c), and a bake unpins it besides; the
# seat rungs the loader once walked off selfpath retired with the modules arc. Bake one
# binary at two names of different lengths and the bytes agree -- so a second name would
# not "differ legitimately", it would just be a second name. The two below still run at
# one path because that is the question's own shape (bake THIS binary twice), and for no
# reason beyond it.
