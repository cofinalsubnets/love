# test/gate/rv64.sh -- the rv64 codegen rung end to end: the whole test/cc battery
# compiled `mooncc -t rv64` (EM_RISCV static ELF, the holo riscv backend), run under
# qemu-riscv64 user mode, and DIFFERENTIAL against the native x64 build of the same
# file. mooncc is its own reference here -- the frontend is shared, so only codegen can
# diverge.
#
# THE UNSUPPORTED FILES ARE ASSERTED, NOT SKIPPED, exactly as ccarch.sh does it: a
# listed program must REFUSE -- nonzero, no signal, a diagnostic naming both the file
# and the CAUSE. A silent skip list is where a regression hides. The day rv64 grows
# one of these lanes its build starts succeeding, this check fails, and the name comes
# off the list.
#
# NOT set -e: both halves capture $? to compare them.
