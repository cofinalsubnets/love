# test/gate/hdiff.sh -- THE FOREIGN-CC DIFFERENTIAL at the host: the one lane a cc that
# is not ours still gets to build.
#
# `love` is mooncc-built and holo-linked in the default lane, so gcc and clang no longer
# touch the vm at all -- and what they would catch, nothing else does. Two things only:
#
#   1. it BUILDS and answers, per cc. semantics are the interpreter's and do not change
#      with the compiler, so re-running the whole corpus through each is spent time -- the
#      quick host suite is the whole reading.
#   2. `vmret` is green, per cc. this is the one that earns the lane: ai_musttail is OWED,
#      and a shape that cannot jump must refuse at compile. mooncc's sibcall pass asks only
#      whether a jump is EMITTABLE, so it waved through a 5-arg caller jumping into a 4-arg
#      callee that clang refuses outright (doc/misc/moon-c-gaps.md). vmret cannot catch it
#      either -- it reads the binary mooncc built, sounding our own rule against our own
#      output. A foreign cc compiling the same file is the only instrument that has.
#
# ⚠ ai_tco=1 IS THE POINT. at tco=0 ai_musttail expands to nothing and this proves nothing,
# which is exactly why love0's clang lane never caught any of it.
#
# usage: hdiff.sh CC..

# vmret is what earns this lane, and it is a NO-OP with a message where no
# disassembler is present -- so without one the loop below would build, run the
# suite, and report "tail-jump clean" having read no instruction at all.

# tail-threaded vm without it, so a cc that lacks it would look like "could not
# build love" -- a failure report for a tree that is fine and a toolchain that is old.
