# test/gate/raw.sh -- the GCC-FREE fixpoint, for one target. Everything test_selfhost
# builds, PLUS our own raw libc (src/apps/moon/lib/nolibc.c: raw-syscall wrappers, mini
# stdio, mmap malloc), the math floor (src/apps/moon/lib/math/am.c, ours), and sys.o (the
# syscall trampoline + our sigsetjmp/longjmp, laid by src/apps/moon/lib/mksys.l) -- then
# OUR OWN static linker (src/core/holo/link.l, via `mooncc a.o..`) binds them. No gcc, no
# glibc, no ld anywhere: the whole chain is love. Corpus green over the fresh egg.
#
# THREE targets, ONE procedure: x64 native, rv64 and a64 under qemu-user. They
# were three near-identical recipes; what actually differs is four things -- the -t
# flag, whether the holo backend has to be loaded for mksys (the host bake carries
# only the native one), which mksys entry lays the syscall leaf, and the runner. A
# fourth target is a case here, not another copy.
#
# make owns the dependency graph, the corpus list AND the source lanes; this owns the
# procedure. NOT set -e: the corpus run captures $? for its own failure message.
# ⚠ the lanes arrive in the environment because the corpus already has the variadic
# tail -- gate_love_c / gate_host_c, mk/common.mk's own. one folder, named lanes: a
# gate that globs a directory instead is a second authority on what the binary is.
#
# usage: gate_love_c=.. gate_host_c=.. raw.sh TARGET OUTDIR LOVE CORPUS.l ..
