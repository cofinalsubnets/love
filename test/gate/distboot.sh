# test/gate/distboot.sh -- the release claim, stated over the artifacts.
#
# THE CLAIM: take either artifact, type `make`, get the SAME binary. SOURCE bootstraps
# through whatever C compiler the machine has; SEED carries its own source, is its own
# toolchain, and touches no ambient compiler at all. Both answer the same bytes.
#
# ⚠ WHY THAT IS EVEN POSSIBLE, and it is not something we engineered for this gate:
# the local cc builds `love0` and NOTHING else (src/build.mk). Every object in the
# shipped binary is mooncc's, compiled by love0 waking mooncc0.image. The bootstrap
# compiler is a scaffold that leaves no trace in the product -- which is the same
# property test_fixpoint asserts within one tree, and whose DDC leg (a foreign
# love0) was audited 2026-07-27. This gate says it ACROSS the artifacts, which is the
# form a person downloading them can care about.
#
# ⚠ THE ARTIFACTS ARE COMPARED TO EACH OTHER, not to the in-tree binary. That is the
# claim as stated: the archive is cut from the tree itself (selfpack, no index and no
# stage), so what you are looking at is what both artifacts carry.
#
# ⚠ AND THE SEED LANE POISONS THE COMPILER. A gate that merely observes the build
# succeed cannot tell whether the bundled love did the work or the ambient gcc quietly
# did it: both produce a working binary. So cc/gcc/clang are shadowed by scripts that
# fail loudly, and the build has to come out the far side anyway.
#
# ⚠ THE SEED CARRIES ITS OWN SOURCE. It holds the source tarball in .rodata
# (tools/mksrc.l, src/host/src.c) and lays it out itself, so one downloaded file needs no tar
# and no second fetch. "It unpacked something" is not the claim -- the tree it lays has to
# BUILD, compilers poisoned. ⚠ and `love seed` is what drives that build, not a bare make:
# the tree carries no love of its own now, so make alone can only mean the ambient cc (and
# would find the poisoned one). A love driving knows its own selfpath and names CC.
#
# ⚠ AND THE CIRCLE IS THE WHOLE CLAIM. The seed rebuilds ITSELF from the source it
# laid, byte for byte -- so it carries everything it was made from and nothing of the
# machine that made it. That leg only became possible once a bake stopped writing the
# baker's ASLR base and hatch time into the image (test_bakerep guards the same law
# cheaply, in the slow gate, so a regression does not wait for a release).
#
# ⚠ THERE WAS A THIRD ARTIFACT, retired 2026-08-13: a FULL tarball, the source tree
# with a baked love in bin/. The seed does that job strictly better -- one file, and
# nothing needed to unpack it -- so its leg here was a third bootstrap proving what
# the seed's already proves.
#
# ⚠ THE SEED IS THE TREE'S OWN out/host/love (seed-universal U2: the host build
# subsumed, the love-<arch> names dissolved). Two consequences ride here: the
# lean tree's binary embeds an archive it must RE-CUT from itself (selfpack --
# leg 4's compare is what holds that re-cut to the byte), and the claim compare
# runs BEFORE the circle leg, whose `make dist` bakes the compared binary in
# place.
#
# Two complete bootstraps and a self-rebuild -- minutes, not seconds. Opt-in, by name.

# ---- 4. THE CIRCLE CLOSES: the artifact rebuilds ITSELF, to the byte ---------
# The chain whole: cut a tarball, bootstrap it, build the artifact, extract the source
# back OUT of the artifact, and rebuild -- and the second artifact is the first one's
# bytes. That is a stronger claim than "it builds": it says the artifact carries
# everything it was made from and nothing about the machine it was made on leaked in.
# ⚠ AND THE DECISION RIDES HERE TOO. This leg is a real `love seed`, not an open-coded
# `make dist` -- the verb's own -wait half IS this leg (build dist in the laid tree, then
# compare selfpath against out/host/love), so running it whole costs a lay more and buys
# the one thing legs 2 and 3 cannot say: that the seed PICKS its own mooncc when no
# ambient compiler works. Legs 2 and 3 name CC by hand and so supply the answer.
# ⚠ PATH IS THE POISON DIR ALONE, not $w/nocc:$PATH. src-cc walks every PATH entry for
# each of cc/gcc/clang, so a prepended poison leaves the machine's real /usr/bin/cc
# reachable and the probe rightly takes it -- the fallback would never fire. The farm
# (src/apps/source/source.l) supplies make/sh/sed and the rest out of the binary itself.
# ⚠ it seeds a FRESH tree rather than rebuilding $selfd, which leg 3 compared: nothing
# here disturbs that artifact, and this leg no longer has to run after it.
#
# ⚠ IT NEEDS A REPRODUCIBLE BAKE, and that is the only reason this leg can exist. An
# image used to carry the baker's ASLR base (raw kept absolutes, the header's address
# pair, a dead JIT husk's W^X pointer) and `born`, the hatch duration -- so two bakes of
# one tree differed by 180012 bytes and no artifact could ever equal another.
# ⚠ and the archive rides ALONG: `love source` lays the very bytes it carried, and a
# re-cut (selfpack, the one cutter) answers the same bytes -- the cmp below is what
# holds that to the byte. Same blob in, same binary out.
