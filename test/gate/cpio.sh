# test/gate/cpio.sh -- src/apps/cpio/cpio.l + src/apps/cpio/cpiocmd.l against the program they replace.
#
# The newc archive is what the kernel unpacks an initramfs from, and `make
# distro-initramfs` is the caller: `find | cpio -o -H newc | gzip -9`, all three of
# them ours now. So the oracle is GNU cpio, in BOTH directions, over a tree chosen
# for the format's edges rather than for size.
#
# ⚠ AGREEING WITH OURSELVES PROVES NOTHING. A packer and an unpacker written by one
# hand invert each other for any format, including one nobody else speaks -- the same
# argument test/gate/targz.sh makes, and the reason this gate is separate from the
# laws in test/host/.
#
# The tree's edges, and what each is for: newc pads the NAME to a 4-byte boundary
# measured from the header's start (110 + namesize), and the BODY to another, so the
# names run 1..4 charms past a multiple of four and the bodies 0..3 -- every pad
# length appears. A SYMLINK's target is its body and is NOT NUL-terminated. An EMPTY
# file and an empty DIRECTORY both carry filesize 0 while meaning different things.
#
# Skips cleanly where cpio is missing, and takes the love binary as $1.
