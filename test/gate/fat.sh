# file answers on the native machine through its prefix + content-named cache,
# the cache holds (a second run lays nothing new), the pack is deterministic to
# the byte, and the foreign member extracts and answers under qemu-user (that
# leg skips loudly without one). HOME points into scratch so the cache the gate
# exercises is its own, never the nest's.
