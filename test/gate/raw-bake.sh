# test/gate/raw-bake.sh -- the WAKE half of the gcc-free image cycle. mooncc could
# never bake before (an EXEC's low load address collides the codec's pointer/fixnum
# index range); a -pie ET_DYN loads high and clears it. Reuses test_raw's objects,
# links them PIE, bakes the post-warm image into the binary's OWN .image (src/host/image.c
# self-patch), then WAKES that image and runs the corpus over the woken heap. This is
# the ONLY gate that exercises ai_image_load on a mooncc binary -- the seam where an
# odd-addressed lvm_* ap mis-encodes as a fixnum, invisible to every egg-boot gate.
#
# The SPLIT: make owns the dependency graph and the file lists; this file owns the
# PROCEDURE, which is why it is a file: a make
# recipe would carry the same steps \-joined into one line with $$ throughout.
#
# NOT set -e: the corpus run captures $? to report the exit code in its own failure
# message, and errexit would abort before the capture (that is also what rules out
# .SHELLFLAGS := -ec for the tree as a whole -- 96 sites do this).
#
# usage: raw-bake.sh OUTDIR CORPUS.l ..
