# test/gate/refuzz.sh -- kore's grep and sed against GNU's, over SEEDED RANDOM
# patterns and subjects, byte-for-byte on stdout and on the exit code.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS BESIDE test_kore's HAND BATTERY. the hand battery is a list
# someone thought of, so it passes exactly the cases its author already had in
# mind. every bug this engine actually shipped -- the ERE loose-repeat drop, -F
# walking a string with `two?` (false for one, so the pattern came out empty and
# matched everything), the zero-length -o match printing a blank line -- was a
# shape nobody would have written down. a random draw does not know what we meant
# either, which is exactly its value: it asks GNU instead of asking us.
#
# ⚠ THE ORACLE MUST BE THE REAL GNU. an interactive `grep` on a dev box may be a
# ugrep shim whose BRE differs (it ERRORS where GNU takes a loose repeat as ink),
# so the oracle is an ABSOLUTE PATH, its --version is checked, and the lane SKIPS
# loudly where GNU is absent. a differential with no independent oracle is not a
# weaker test, it is not a test.
#
# ⚠ GNU grep AND GNU sed DO NOT SHARE AN ERE DIALECT, which is why the atom sets
# below are per-tool. `grep -E ')'` matches a literal paren; `sed -E 's/)/X/'`
# quits with "Unmatched ) or \)". same for an unclosed `{`. our engine follows
# GREP there (apps/kore/re.l's `loose`), so the sed lane simply does not draw the
# two shapes -- rather than pretend one answer is right for both tools.
#
# ⚠ SEEDED, NOT RANDOM: the draw is a pure function of $seed, so a red run
# reproduces exactly and a green one means the same thing tomorrow. raise
# REFUZZ_ROUNDS by hand when hunting; never make either time-dependent.
