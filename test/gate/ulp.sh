# test/gate/ulp.sh -- the MATH FLOOR differential: apps/moon/lib/math/am.c
# measured against the host libm, and -- the half that matters -- measured
# TWICE, once compiled by mooncc and once by the system cc, with the two
# reports required to agree BYTE FOR BYTE.
#
# WHY THE SECOND HALF EXISTS. `make ulp` has measured am.c since it was
# written, but always the $(CC) build of it, so it answered "is the ALGORITHM
# accurate" and never "does OUR COMPILER build it". am.c's own header claimed
# "the mooncc-compiled object measures IDENTICAL to gcc's" -- true when a hand
# check made it so, and quietly false afterwards. two mooncc bugs were living
# in that gap on 2026-07-29, both invisible to a green test_slow:
#
#   * the 4th integer parameter could be lost outright (its arrival register
#     taken as scratch after the ride analysis licensed it). am.c's mul64 lost
#     its `lo` out-pointer, so am_sin/am_cos SEGFAULTED for every |x| >= 2^19
#     -- reachable from the shipping binary as `(sine 1e20)`.
#   * an unsigned 64-bit value converted to double SIGNED, so (double)~0ull
#     was -1. rbig's G1 word crosses 2^63 on most inputs and sin/cos drifted
#     to 1609 ulp past the Payne-Hanek handoff -- while every argument BELOW
#     the handoff stayed exact, which is why nothing else noticed.
#
# neither is a math bug and neither shows in a value the corpus asserts. float
# BITS are where a codegen fault hides best: an ordinary C test compares ints
# and a wrong low mantissa bit still prints "0.1". so the differential is the
# instrument, and the mooncc side is the point of it.
#
# the ACCURACY half is gated too, against am.c's documented stance -- so a
# change to the algorithm that loses precision fails here rather than being
# discovered by a later differential. the bounds are the measured maxima; they
# are a CEILING, and beating one is free (lower the bound in the same commit).
#
# hosted only: the oracle IS the system libm, so this cannot run on the kernel
# or wasm -- exactly like `make ulp`, whose procedure this owns.
# make owns the dependency graph; this owns the procedure.
# NOT set -e: the checks report their own failures with context.
#
# usage: ulp.sh OUTDIR LOVE
