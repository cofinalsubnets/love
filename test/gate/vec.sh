# test/gate/vec.sh -- the INTERRUPT gate.
#
# src/mkvec.l lays the exception and IRQ entry points that used to be
# x64/x64.S and a64/a64.S. a green `make test_disk` already
# proves most of that lay by running it: nothing boots without archinit's IDT,
# and the corpus is FED over the serial line and CLOCKED by the timer, so
# uart_isr and timer_isr run thousands of times per gate. what a green boot
# never touches is the part that only runs when something goes wrong --
# the 32 exception stubs, the common tail, and a64's fault vector.
#
# so this gate makes something go wrong, on purpose, and reads the report:
#
#   1. THE FAULT PATH, BOOTED. `(fault n)` (kmain.c's nif -> k_fault_trigger in
#      each arch.c) raises a real CPU exception. the kernel dispatches it
#      through the vector table we laid, and prints what it caught. the vectors
#      below are chosen to cover BOTH stub shapes: the CPU pushes an error code
#      for 8, 10..14, 17, 21, 29 and 30 and for nothing else, so those stubs
#      push one word and the other twenty-two push a dummy zero first. #PF is
#      the load-bearing case -- it is an error-code vector AND it reports both
#      `err` and `cr2`, so a stub on the wrong side of that split would shift
#      the whole frame and misreport all three fields.
#   2. THE STUBS THE FAULT PATH CANNOT REACH. five vectors are booted above;
#      the other twenty-seven come off the same loop, and a loop is exactly the
#      thing that goes wrong at one end. so the laid object is read back and
#      the error-code split is checked stub by stub against the architecture's
#      own list -- and on a64, that the vector table is 2 KiB-aligned with
#      one entry every 0x80 and exactly one of the sixteen (index 5, current EL
#      with SP_ELx, IRQ) going somewhere different from the rest.
#
# a faulted kernel HALTS by design (k_exception does not return), so each boot
# is stopped as soon as its report lands rather than waited out.
