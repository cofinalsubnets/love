# test/gate/cli.sh -- the CLI's EXIT STATUS, which nothing else pinned.
#
# src/core/boot/cli.l's every failure lane ends in a status: 1 for a file it cannot open, 2
# for a malformed flag or a torn -e, 0 for -v/-h, and a verb's own charm for the
# verb rail. Not one of them was gated -- test_seat drives the file seat and reads
# what it SAYS, the corpus never runs the flags at all, and every other gate calls
# the binary in a way that would not notice a status going wrong. So the six exits
# could have been renumbered, or silently turned into 0, under a green test_slow.
#
# That matters more than it looks: `love -e ... || die` in a script, and cook's and
# make's exit-status contract, both read this and nothing else. The lane got rebuilt
# when cli.l moved off `quit` onto a scare + one trap (kore's uleave/urun shape, so
# a caller in the same image can catch a leave instead of dying), and the whole
# point of that change is that the numbers do NOT move.
#
