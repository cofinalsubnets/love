# test/gate/run.sh -- the corpus-gate shape, in one place: run a love over some source, keep
# the WHOLE output, and hold it to exit 0 AND every sentinel. A red prints what was said and
# names which half failed -- the exit or the missing line.
#
# usage: <source> | run.sh NAME LOVE SENTINEL[|SENTINEL...]
#        run.sh -a NAME LOVE SENTINEL[|SENTINEL...] FILE...
#
# By default the source arrives on stdin, which is how the corpus keeps its one global scope
# (the caller cats what it wants together). -a hands the FILES to the love as arguments with
# stdin closed instead -- for a gate whose subject must not be cat'd in, and for the lanes
# that test stdin itself.
#
# /warn LOVE is a word LIST, not a path: an egg lane is `env LOVE_NO_IMAGE=1 out/love`,
# so it must go unquoted here. The caller quotes it as one argument; this splits it back.

# guards every gate, present and future, instead of 34 files each remembering to.
