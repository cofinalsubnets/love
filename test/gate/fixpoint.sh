# test/gate/fixpoint.sh -- the SELF-REGENERATION fixpoint (self-host rung 2).
# The default out/host/love is mooncc-built already (love0 waking mooncc0.image
# compiles every TU, holo links -pie). This gate closes the loop: relink that
# generation as love1, let love1 bake its OWN mooncc image and rebuild every TU
# with itself, link love2 the same way, and assert love1 == love2 TO THE BYTE.
# One diff = the fixpoint + the determinism differential + the trusting-trust
# half in a single compare (the DDC leg proper adds a foreign-compiled love0;
# the 2026-07-27 audit ran that lane green).
#
# make owns the dependency graph (the moon_o objects + mooncc0.image exist) AND the
# source lanes; this owns the procedure. NOT set -e: the compile loop reports its own
# file. ⚠ the lanes arrive in the environment because the object list already has the
# variadic tail -- gate_love_c / gate_host_c / gate_arch_c, mk/common.mk's own.
