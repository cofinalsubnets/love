# test/gate/objcopy.sh -- core/holo/copy.l against the tool it replaces. objcopy's two
# output formats are a WIRE, not a taste: the .hex a Teensy loader accepts and the .bin
# whose offsets are flash offsets. So the gate is a byte comparison with the real thing
# over every ELF on hand, both formats, and nothing softer.
#
# The fixtures are minted by our OWN linker at addresses chosen to reach the rules a
# board's image happens to miss: a section straddling a 64K line (a data record has to
# stop there, not wrap), and an image climbing past 1 MB (the base record changes AGE
# there -- an 8086 segment below, a linear half above, and they SUM, so the segment has
# to be zeroed on the way through). A binary in /usr/bin brings the third: a dynamic
# exe loads .note / .dynsym / .rela, which are not PROGBITS and are still image bytes.
#
# Skips where no objcopy exists -- there is no oracle then, and the ports' own boot-image
# verifies (test_teensy41 / test_nucleo446 / test_rp2040) still read what we wrote.
#
# usage: objcopy.sh OUTDIR
