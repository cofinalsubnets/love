# test/gate/cts.sh -- mooncc against an OUTSIDE corpus: c-testsuite's 220 single-file
# programs, each with the stdout+stderr it must print. Four targets, one procedure
# (ccarch.sh's shape; node is the wasm machine, as in ccwasm.sh).
#
# WHY THIS AND NOT MORE test/cc FILES. Every file in test/cc/ was written here, and
# nearly all of them were written to pin a fault we had already tripped over -- so the
# battery says what we have already learned and nothing about what we have not. This
# corpus was written by people compiling other compilers, and its FIRST run found nine
# programs mooncc compiles clean and answers wrong, two of them by segfaulting, plus
# nineteen it refuses. None of the nine had a consumer here yet, which is the whole
# point: they were waiting for one.
#
# THE ORACLE IS THE CORPUS'S OWN .expected FILE, not gcc. That is the difference from
# every other cc gate here -- an expected output written by a third party is an
# independent opinion, where gcc is a second one that can share our reading of a
# murky rule. (gcc passes all 220 on this box; the roster below is therefore ours.)
#
# THE FAILURES ARE ROSTERED, NOT SKIPPED, with a cause each -- and the roster is
# double-edged: a program not on it must pass, and a program ON it must still fail.
# So a fix that lands takes its line off this list, and a regression cannot hide in a
# skip. The KIND is asserted too, because the two are not the same news: `refuses` is
# mooncc saying no and naming the file, and costs an afternoon; `wrong` is mooncc
# compiling clean and handing back a wrong answer, and costs a wrong artifact. A
# refusal degrading into a wrong answer must be loud.
#
# Skips whole (exit 0, with the clone line) when the corpus is not here -- it is an
# imported tree like the package rungs, found under dl/ then $MOONSRC (~/src), and
# `make dl/c-testsuite` fetches it. The cross lanes skip without their qemu.
# make owns the dependency graph; this owns the procedure.
# NOT set -e: the checks report their own failures with context.
