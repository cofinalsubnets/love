# test/net/loopback.sh -- the aineko loopback gate (host-only, NOT in the portable
# corpus, so `make test` and the kernel/wasm builds stay socket-free). Drives the
# real binary: a server task and a client over TCP 127.0.0.1, full-duplex, and
# asserts each side received exactly what the other sent. This exercises every
# Stage-1 socket nif (connect/listen/accept/shutdown) plus the two .l pump loops
# and their teardown.
#
#   sh test/net/loopback.sh <ai-binary> [port]
#
# Exits 0 + prints "nettest: PASS" on a clean round-trip; nonzero + a diff on any
# mismatch, error, or hang (bounded by a readiness deadline).
