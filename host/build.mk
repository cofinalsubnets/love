# The DEFAULT flavor owns out/host; the other flavor builds in its own hsuf'd
# tree (common.mk: out/host-glibc when musl is the default, out/host-musl when
# it isn't), so a musl build never overwrites glibc objects -- musl's bare
# `sigsetjmp` vs glibc's `__sigsetjmp` macro would otherwise poison a cross-libc
# relink. The .hostcc stamp below catches the IN-PLACE flips (musl-clang
# appearing/vanishing changes what out/host means). The bootstrap (love0) + the
# generated out/lib/*.h headers stay PINNED to canonical out/host paths and
# plain $(CC): love0 never goes musl.

# STATIC=1 links a fully static `love` against musl (and skips liblove.so, which a
# static build can't produce) -- the OPT-IN portable-binary lane (was briefly
# the Linux default; demoted 2026-07-07, the why lives in common.mk's flavor
# block): the binary runs on ANY Linux distro regardless of
# glibc version AND still does DNS -- static *glibc* can't resolve hostnames
# (getaddrinfo needs NSS via dlopen, impossible when static), but musl resolves
# itself, so ain's `connect host port` works. Costs +1% size (~55K of text, the
# whole libc; the ~4M baked image dwarfs it) at the same test-corpus speed.
# musl-clang is clang (matches our clang default) + the musl libc -- the clean
# path. VALIDATED: fully static, `ldd` = not-a-dynamic-executable, runs,
# getaddrinfo baked in, full corpus green. `make STATIC=1` builds in its own
# out/host-musl tree -- no need to clean between flavors.
# musl is Linux-only -- this is the Linux portable-binary artifact, NOT the mac
# build (mac = a native Apple-clang build).
# FALLBACK: `STATIC=1 CC=musl-gcc` works too but is a gcc wrapper; on Arch its
# spec injects a phantom `-latomic_asneeded` (we use no real atomics -- only
# volatile sig_atomic_t flags), so it needs an empty stub on the link path:
#   ar rcs /tmp/libatomic_asneeded.a; make STATIC=1 CC=musl-gcc EXTRA_CFLAGS=-L/tmp

# means; an explicit CC=) rebuilds the tree instead of relinking mixed-libc

# the default BOOT IMAGE: `$< --bake` boots the freshly-linked binary, snapshots the post-warm
# heap (the glaze baked in, x86-64), and lays it back into the binary's OWN .image section --
# host/image.c copies the exe, pwrites the blob at the section's file offset, and atomically
# renames over the original (no objcopy/objdump, ETXTBSY-proof: a new inode, so anyone still
# executing keeps the old one). A plain `love` then wakes it at ~4 ms cold start (glazed by
# default) instead of eval'ing the egg (~230 ms). The load is an OPTIMIZATION -- main.c falls
# back to a normal egg boot on any mismatch, so a stale bake is never fatal, only slower.
