# t/gate/cookdiff.sh -- cook against GNU make, differentially. The oracle is a
# SECOND IMPLEMENTATION, not our own expectations: each case is a tiny Makefile run
# by both, and the outputs must agree byte for byte.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR IS SILENCE. An unknown `$(name args)` is a VARIABLE
# reference in make's grammar, not an error -- so a builtin cook has never implemented
# expands to nothing and the build carries on with an empty value. That is how
# `$(error ..)` guards were no-ops here, and it is invisible to any test that only
# asks whether cook agrees with itself. Six functions and two real bugs came out of
# the first sweep of this file.

# THE ORACLE RUNS TOP-LEVEL. under `make -jN` the outer make exports MAKEFLAGS with
# its jobserver, and the make below would inherit it -- a parallel oracle reorders any
# case whose target has two independent prerequisites, so `all: a | b` prints [b] before
# [a] about 1 run in 12 and the gate reports COOK as failing when the oracle moved. cook
# is serial, so only one side of the differential was drifting. a differential is worth
# exactly what its oracle's determinism is worth.

# prints and make does not IS the difference the gate exists to find.
