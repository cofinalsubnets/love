/* __attribute__((aligned(N))) on a data declarator is HONORED, not skipped --
 * a skipped aligned(N) silently misaligns the object (page tables, DMA), which
 * is worse than the old parse error. exercises: the array-declarator trailing
 * run (the shape that refused), a scalar between neighbours that would land it
 * off-grain, an initialized aligned global (bytes AND boundary), and bare
 * `aligned`, whose N is the target's own __BIGGEST_ALIGNMENT__ -- 16 nearly
 * everywhere, 8 under AAPCS32, which is why the check asks the macro and not a
 * number. gcc agrees on every exit. */
