/* The allocator's contract, held against the C library's. moonlibc hands any request of
 * 128 kB or more a mapping of its own so that free can give the pages back, and calloc
 * skips the memset on those because the kernel has already zeroed them -- so the size a
 * request lands on decides which path serves it, and both paths owe the caller exactly
 * the same promises. A block must be zero when calloc says so, must keep its bytes
 * across a realloc that moves it, must survive being freed and asked for again, and a
 * multiply that wraps must refuse rather than hand back something too small.
 *
 * The sizes straddle that threshold deliberately: small enough to ride the arena, large
 * enough to take a mapping, and one either side of the boundary itself.
 *
 * Every check contributes 1, so the exit code IS the number that passed. */
