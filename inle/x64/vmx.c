// vmx -- the Intel twin of svm.c, answering the same question on
// the other vendor: can a guest run under inle, and does the exit land back in
// ordinary C? Enable VMX, build one VMCS, run a seven-byte 32-bit guest that
// loads a sentinel and executes CPUID, and take the exit.
//
// It is the same spike and roughly three times the file, for three reasons the
// SVM half did not have to pay:
//   * the VMCS is OPAQUE. Every field goes through vmwrite with its own
//     encoding -- forty-odd of them, where the VMCB was plain stores.
//   * a VM exit resumes at HOST_RIP, not after the launch, so the entry is an
//     assembly block with a label (asmops.h's k_vmlaunch) rather than a call.
//   * real mode needs "unrestricted guest", which needs EPT. So this guest runs
//     in 32-bit PAGED protected mode instead, and brings its own page directory
//     -- and a TSS, and a GDT, because VMX checks host and guest TR and inle
//     has never had one.
//
// The guest runs under EPT, so it has an address space of its own: it believes
// its code is at guest-physical 0 and its page directory at 0x1000, and neither
// is true of the machine. There are now TWO translations under every guest
// fetch -- the guest's own directory turns a linear address into a
// guest-physical one, and the EPT turns that into a host-physical one -- and
// the gate's laws cannot pass unless both happened.
//
// ⚠ every physical address is `va - khhdm`, which holds for kernel-heap memory
// and NOT for image statics -- blk.c's law. The caller hands in one
// k_vmx_need() block and everything is carved out of it.
