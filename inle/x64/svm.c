// svm -- the AMD-V spike: can a guest run under inle, and does the
// exit land back in ordinary C? Enable SVM, build one VMCB, run a six-byte
// real-mode guest that loads a sentinel and executes CPUID, and take the
// intercept. The answer comes back as three numbers the gate can read.
//
// The question this file exists to answer is about the EXIT PATH, not about
// virtualization: `vmrun` returns to the instruction after itself, so the
// handler is straight-line C right here and the love VM above never learns a
// guest ran. That shape is AMD's -- the Intel twin has to stand up a host-RIP
// entry point of its own to say the same thing.
//
// ⚠ every physical address is `va - khhdm`, which holds for kernel-heap memory
// and NOT for image statics -- blk.c's law, same reason. The caller hands in
// one k_svm_need() block and everything below is carved out of it.
// ⚠ this file keeps NO state: the block lives in kmain's hand, the CPU's own
// enable bit is idempotent, and the VMCB is rebuilt on every run.
