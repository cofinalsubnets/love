(* proof/patch.v -- the PATCH GROUPOID, the hand-proven slices, machine-checked in Rocq.

   The design lives in doc/proto/patch.l (the runnable toy + the argument that a
   distribution, a namespace, and a repo state are ONE algebra of selectable sets,
   with COMMUTE the primitive underneath). That toy DEMONSTRATES the laws at
   runtime; this file upgrades demonstrate toward PROVE -- the commute laws as
   theorems in a consistent metatheory.

   Scope: the NAMED-SLOT model -- a tree is a total map (key -> value), a patch is
   a single slot-change carrying its context (old -> new). This is darcs's "file
   of named lines" abstraction, where commutation is the CLEAN case (independent
   patches touch different slots and do not shift). Its four laws (L1 commute
   involutive, L2 inverse round-trips in context, L3a independent patches are
   order-free -- the semantic heart that makes merge/cherry-pick sound, L3b a
   frontier is stable under an adjacent independent swap -- the reproducibility
   tie) were the FIRST slice here, and are the first RETIRED: the uu-term rung
   landed them as uu proof terms (test/uupatch.l), which tools/uu2coq.l +
   tools/uu2lean.l emit into proof/rocq/uugen.v AND proof/lean/uugen.lean --
   uu_commute_involutive / uu_invert_roundtrip / uu_commute_sound /
   uu_applall_swap, axiom-free in BOTH kernels under make test_uugen +
   test_uulean.

   The SECOND slice (the positional rung, opened 2026-07-12) is RETIRED too:
   HUNKS over a sequence, where a commuted q' is a genuine re-aim -- its index
   slides by the other hunk's length delta -- and touching hunks refuse to
   commute (strict: a seam has no canonical order once inserts land on it;
   adjacency would break L1). Its four laws migrated to the same generated
   leg -- uu_hcommute_involutive / uu_hinv_roundtrip / uu_hcommute_sound (via
   uu_splice_after_comm + uu_splice_before_comm, the honest contexts pinning
   the seams) / uu_hfold_swap -- each intermediate its own SEALED lemma
   (test/uupatch.l's ladder). The hunk record and splice STAY here as the
   vocabulary the later slices ride, with the splice-algebra little lemmas.

   The THIRD slice (the conflictor rung, same day) closes commute's refusal
   gap: a real merge RECORDS instead of refusing. The state enlarges (pijul's
   move, not darcs 1.x's exotic patch algebra) -- a conflicted slot holds a
   CLASH, the shared base plus a canonically-ordered rival set -- and merge
   (pull, factoring through merge1) is total. Its laws, same axiom-free rule:
     (M1) pull_merge_comm   rivals land the same cell either order, from ANY
                            starting slot (so three-way convergence is M1 twice)
     (M2) pull_idem         pulling a patch again settles
     (M3) pull_records      the cell keeps the base AND both rivals
     (M4) pull_fold_swap    a frontier is stable under ANY adjacent swap --
                            independent OR conflicting: pull order is dead
     (M5) resolve_roundtrip a resolution is an ordinary patch off the cell,
                            and unpulling it returns the clash
   The FOURTH slice (the identity rung, same day): a version IS its patch set.
   Per-patch content hashes fold through cins -- the same canonical set that
   carries a clash's rivals -- so the identity quotients by exactly what the
   semantics proved dead and nothing more:
     (H1) fid_swap  order-free   (the uu_applall_swap / pull_fold_swap face)
     (H2) fid_dup   multiplicity-free  (the pull_idem face)
   The FIFTH slice (the tree lift, 2026-07-13): a hunk gets a PATH, and the
   shift algebra climbs the levels -- four commute lanes by path relation,
   with a genuine PATH re-aim at the crossing:
     (L1) tcommute_involutive  (the algebra half; the tree APPLY laws are
          asserted in the .l -- their crossing-level core IS splice_after/
          before_comm with singleton hunks -- and join the uu-term rung)
   The SIXTH slice (the content-rewrite rung, same day): the swallow refusal
   opens -- a shallow patch that MOVES the subtree a deep patch edited
   commutes by rewriting its context THROUGH the content (undo the deep edit
   in both sides, re-aim at the survivor's seat, occurrence guards keeping
   the match canonical). Proven at ELEMENT grain (the deep edit as "at seat
   j, a becomes b"; the rose-tree unit walk stays in the .l):
     (L1) swal_involutive  (through the groupoid inverse -- exactly the .l's
          mirror lane wiring, so involution is the algebra, not a re-check)
   The SEVENTH slice (the clash-segments rung, same day): the conflictor
   cell lifted to sequences -- pijul's graggle corner. Overlapping / touching
   / same-seam rivals collapse the union hull of their base spans to ONE
   clash element, the BUBBLE; rivals are segments, cins-canonical by content
   hash; a rival extending past a landed bubble WIDENS it over the union
   hull (the same day's second half). Proven at hash grain:
     (M1) scell_comm   the bubble forgets arrival order (min/max + cins_comm)
     (--)  splice_pad  padding commutes with rendering -- a rival padded up
           when the bubble widens IS the rival rendered over the wide hull,
           so mixed-span arrival order is dead too
     (--)  bubble_len  one seat, rival sizes nowhere in the merged length --
           downstream seats determinate before anyone resolves
   The EIGHTH slice (the metavariable rung, same day): patches grow
   variables and become rewrite RULES -- the unifier takes the application
   seat (valid matches, apon instantiates), and the schematic swallow
   commutes with the rule UNCHANGED: the variable abstracts the content, so
   form six's rewrite-through vanishes into address algebra. Proven in the
   lane's two halves:
     (--)  mtch_sound        matching is SOUND: a pattern instantiated with
           its own bindings reproduces the ground term (non-linear patterns
           bind consistently -- the kanren move, on cap/cup cells)
     (L1)  reaim_involutive  the deep patch's seat re-aim (olds seat -> news
           seat, prefix surgery) swaps home
   The NINTH slice (the critical-pairs rung, 2026-07-14): schematic-vs-
   schematic -- two REWRITE RULES meet on one tree, and the seat relation
   decides. DIVERGING seats commute with NO re-aim (tree addresses do not
   shift under a disjoint rewrite -- the sequence slices' index slide
   vanishes at tree grain), and any overlap is REFUSED with the refusal
   EARNED: a concrete pair of rules on one ground where both orders succeed
   and disagree, so no total commute exists at rule grain:
     (L3a) rw_comm_div  diverging-seat rewrites are order-free (the match
           verdicts on the shared ground carry across the other rule's put;
           gput_comm_div closes) -- the semantic heart at rule grain
     (--)  cp_earned    the critical pair: same seat, two rules, both
           orders green, DIFFERENT trees -- overlap refusal is forced,
           not conservative
   Still deliberately out (the next refinements): the variable-overlap lane
   (a redex nested under a METAVARIABLE of the other rule's lhs commutes for
   LINEAR rules by sliding to the variable's rhs seat -- mvswal's rule-rule
   face) and joinability of critical pairs (Knuth-Bendix territory: WHICH
   overlaps are harmless is a completion question, not a commute question).

   Method note, matching gc.v / spec.v house rule: NO Axiom, NO Admitted, NO
   classical / funext escape hatch. Trees are functions, so equality of trees is
   POINTWISE (forall k, ...) throughout -- we never assume functional
   extensionality; every theorem quantifies the key.

   PROVENANCE -- this file is SCAFFOLDING, not the destination. It is hand-authored
   (spec.v tier), and a hand-authored proof model DRIFTS from the code it mirrors
   -- the lesson wm2uu already banked when it retired the hand StackSet model for a
   generated-and-gated one. The house pattern is: the ai implementation is the
   source of truth; the Rocq/Lean is EMITTED and drift-gated. The route is now
   OPEN: the named-slot slice went first (test/uupatch.l -- the laws as uu proof
   TERMS, isdeceqnat's coprod carrying the evidence Nat.eqb dropped, emitted to
   both kernels by tools/uu2coq.l + tools/uu2lean.l and audited axiom-free), and
   its hand copy is deleted from here. Each remaining slice migrates the same
   way as its model stabilizes -- the positional slice next (splice/firstn/skipn
   need a list library at uu, the one piece uupatch.l didn't build); the file
   shrinks slice by slice until it is gone. Until then it pins the remaining
   theorem statements and proves each slice is real.

(* ============================================================ *)

(* Mirror of test/patch.l's fifth form, the algebra half. A patch is a hunk
   plus a PATH to the sequence it splices; the load-bearing fact is that a
   deep patch never changes an ancestor's length, so only same-sequence
   patches shift INDICES while a shallow splice re-aims a deeper patch's path
   COMPONENT at the crossing. tcommute has four lanes by path relation. The
   elements stay abstract (Section variable): L1 is pure path/index algebra.

   The tree APPLY laws (L2/L3 at tree grain) are asserted in the .l; their
   crossing-level semantic core is ALREADY the proven uu_splice_after_comm /
   uu_splice_before_comm (uugen.v/uugen.lean) with singleton hunks (editing
   inside element j IS splice s j 1 [x]), and the remaining rose-tree plumbing
   joins the uu migration rather than growing this scaffold. *)
