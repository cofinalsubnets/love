(* encli_drive.ml -- drives the EXTRACTED, machine-checked immediate encoder
   (encli_ref.ml, coqc'd from proof/rocq/encli.v with li_roundtrip_ok proven
   axiom-free) against holo's own x86-64 encoder.

   For every dest in the 16-register file x a spread of immediates hitting all
   three forms (b8 imm32 zero-extend / C7 imm32 sign-extend / movabs imm64) and
   their range boundaries, it computes the reference bytes with the proven
   `encode_li`, then prints an ai program asserting holo's holo-hex is BYTE-
   IDENTICAL. "P / P PASS" means holo's immediate-load FORM CHOICE + serialization
   is exactly what the machine-checked reference produces.

   Note: OCaml's native int is 63-bit and ExtrOcamlZInt's Euclidean mod/div
   overflows at min_int (-2^62), so this differential keeps immediates safely
   inside +-(2^60). The Rocq proof is over unbounded Z and covers the full 64-bit
   range including the movabs top-bit cases (2^63-1, -2^63). *)
