   regenerate with `make test_gen`. Each integer-comparison corpus assert is
   translated to Coq, with its source assert shown in the comment above it.
   The proofs are `vm_compute. reflexivity.`: every goal is a CLOSED computation,
   so vm_compute RUNS both sides (Coq's bytecode VM -- fast even on bignums like
   2^64) to a normal form, and reflexivity checks the two results are identical.
   A church numeral n applied to x is x ** n (`appZ`); a list/string nets the
   sum of its elements/bytes (`asum`). The MODEL IS SHARED: this file imports
   proof/rocq/spec.v and checks against ITS definitions -- appZ/asum/aprod/amax/vscale/srep
   verbatim, iotaZ the Z-arg face, app_appZ proving appZ IS the nat `app` -- so the
   generated instances and the hand-written LAWS speak one model. The defs below are
   gen-only (no spec.v twin): amin, leqb, the TOTAL vaddt (spec.v's vadd is option-
   valued for its shape-mismatch law), vquot, hget, and the syntactic kind lattice. *)
