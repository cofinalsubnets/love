# run.sh <lang> <benches> [timeout] [skip] [samples] -- run one language across
# the named benches.
#
# Emits one raw "<name> <lang> <reps> <ms> <chk>" result line per bench on stdout
# (the Makefile redirects them into out/bench/<lang>.txt) and a progress tick per
# bench on stderr. Each bench is run `samples` times (default 5); the line whose
# per-iteration time (ms/reps) is the MEDIAN of the samples is the one reported.
# Median -- not min -- is the honest central tendency for a GC'd language: a GC
# pause is intrinsic cost, so min would catch the runs that happened to dodge a
# collection and SYSTEMATICALLY under-report it, biasing toward high-variance
# collectors (the artifact that made a generational build look like a `hash`
# regression). Median is robust to BOTH the GC-lucky lows AND OS-noise highs.
# Each sample runs under `timeout` (default 30s); a bench that times out or
# errors on every sample produces no line, so a language that can't finish a
# workload drops that cell rather than failing the build. `skip` is a
# space-separated list of <lang>:<bench> pairs known to time out; those are
# dropped up front, so the build never pays the timeout wall for them. If the
# interpreter/compiler isn't on PATH the whole language is skipped. BENCH_LANG is
# exported so the shared harnesses (lib/bench.* + lib/Bench.*) print the right
# column label.
