# ccnif.sh -- mooncc's codegen against gcc's and clang's, on the three files in
# host/ that ask the most of it. NOT A GATE and deliberately not wired into one:
# it is a development instrument, run by hand while working on gen.l, and what it
# prints is three readings of the same source, not a verdict.
#
# THE SUBJECT is src/host/hash.c and src/core/gz.c -- sha-256, md5,
# crc32, cksum, DEFLATE and inflate. They are the widest C the tree owns and the
# least like the rest of it: 32-bit rotates, a wrapping add carried over eight
# registers, two table walks reading EIGHT INDEPENDENT lookups a step, a 64-bit
# accumulator shifted by a runtime count, a hash-chain match finder, an insertion
# sort over packed keys, and an eight-in-order copy that is deliberately not a
# word move. love.c has none of those shapes, so nothing else here reads them --
# and mooncc compiles all three into the shipped artifact.
#
# ⚠ THE HARNESSES INCLUDE THE .c. Every entry point in the three files is a
# static, so a program that includes the source sees the algorithm whole and no
# seam had to be cut into host/ to reach it. What the love-facing wrappers name is
# stubbed (nif/stub.h) -- main() enters at the algorithm and the lvm ops are never
# called, they only have to link. That trick works for any host/*.c nif.
#
# THREE READINGS, and they answer different questions:
#
#   answers -- every lane runs the same report and the reports are diffed. A
#              divergence is a MISCOMPILE and the only place in this script where
#              one compiler can be said to be wrong. gcc runs at -O0 as well as
#              -O2, and those two are compared to EACH OTHER first: where the
#              oracle disagrees with itself the fault is undefined behaviour in
#              OUR source and not a mooncc bug, which is a different repair.
#   text    -- .text bytes per lane. The whole-file number is exact, off the
#              section header, and it is the only SOUND total: gcc and clang
#              inline statics out of existence, so a sum over the names two lanes
#              share charges mooncc for a callee its opposite number already paid
#              for inside a caller. Under it, the widest per-function ratios --
#              which is what actually names a lane worth working on.
#   time    -- the algorithms run for real, one row each, median of SAMPLES. The
#              shell holds the clock: the two builds carry different libcs, so a
#              program reading its own would time the clock as much as the code.
#
# ⚠ READ THE TIME ROWS IN PAIRS, never as one number. crc32 and cksum are branch-
# free table walks; sha-256 and md5 are register pressure with no memory in the
# loop; deflate is pointer chasing; inflate is a branch per symbol. mooncc level
# on one and far behind on another names the lane that wants work -- which is the
# whole reason this prints six rows and not an average. (bench/ccbench.sh
# times three of these too, but through the SHIPPED BINARY's nifs, where the love
# runtime and the libc are in the picture; here nothing is but the code.)
#
# usage: ./ccnif.sh [reps] [samples]
#   reps    passes over the timed corpus per run (default 24)
#   samples timed runs per row, median reported (default 3)
#
# x86-64 only -- mooncc emits x64 here. Needs `make host` first (out/love IS
# the compiler under test) and whichever of gcc/clang are on PATH.
