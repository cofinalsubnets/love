# ccbench.sh -- the COMPILER shootout (the page's FOURTH table). Builds the love host
# binary with three C compilers and, for each, reports four wall-clock costs:
#   build : compile every C translation unit (src/core/love.c + host/*.c + the am math floor)
#           and link a working `love` -- source to runnable binary. ⚠ the mooncc lane
#           builds ONCE UNTIMED first; the note above that call says why, and the row read
#           2.2x too high until it did.
#   test  : run the full arch-neutral corpus ($t, the same files test_host/test_raw
#           feed) through the binary that build produced, with egg-boot EXCLUDED
#           (subtracted) so it times the suite executing, not the compiler self-install.
#   chacha / poly1305 : one C function each, same subtraction (bench/ccrypto.l).
#           These are here because the corpus row averages a compiler's work over all
#           of src/core/love.c, and the average is flattering: mooncc/clang reads ~1.1x there
#           and ~23x on chacha. chacha20 indexes a 16-word state ARRAY in its inner
#           loop, poly1305 keeps five limbs as scalar LOCALS, and mooncc has register
#           residency for the second shape only -- so the PAIR is the reading. Wide
#           chacha beside narrow poly says the gap is array slots; the day they close
#           together is the day that reading was wrong.
#   inflate / crc32 / sha256 : the HEAVY NIFS (bench/cnifs.l), and a different
#           question from the pair above. The ciphers are a lever chosen to name a
#           defect; these three are work the tree waits on -- `love source` unpacks its
#           own tarball through inflate and checks it with crc32, and every svalbard
#           blob id is a sha256. They are also three shapes: inflate is BRANCHY (a bit
#           reader and a table per symbol), crc32 has no branch in its loop at all, and
#           sha256 carries a 64-word array beside eight scalars -- the ciphers' two
#           shapes in one function. A lane behind on inflate and level on crc32 is
#           losing to branches, not to loads.
# The three compilers, ALL THREE STATIC -- that is the whole point of the pairing:
#   mooncc : love's OWN C compiler (src/apps/moon/), run out of THE SHIPPED ARTIFACT's own
#            `mooncc` verb -- no gcc/glibc/ld anywhere: mooncc lays every .o, mksys emits
#            the syscall leaf, our linker (src/core/holo/) binds.
#   gcc-musl / clang-musl : the same translation units at the host's real -O2 cflags,
#            through the musl-gcc/musl-clang wrappers and linked -static. Also
#            egg-boot -- no `bake`, so all three lanes run the identical corpus off
#            the freshly-eval'd egg (a level field).
#
# ⚠ the natives are STATIC MUSL, not the distro's dynamic glibc, and the size rows are
# why: mooncc's binary is a static ELF carrying its own nolibc, so racing it against a
# dynamic binary asks two questions at once and answers neither -- ~40 KB of the gap it
# used to report was glibc being ABSENT from the file. Runtime is untouched by the
# choice (measured: under 0.1% on insns, cycles and boot -- love runs on its own floor,
# so libc barely executes), so the corpus rows compare straight across the change.
# CCGLIBC=1 adds the old dynamic gcc/clang lanes back alongside, for continuity.
#
# Emits "<phase> <compiler> <ms> <note>" lines (the 4-field satrace shape), so
# mkhtml renders it like the SAT table -- one row per phase, columns the compilers,
# net their sum (source to a tested and measured binary). A missing/failed lane
# shows dnf.
#
# Requires `make host` first: the generated out/lib/*.h headers and out/love, which
# is also the ARTIFACT (the seed) -- the mooncc lane runs it and not an intermediate;
# see the note on SEED.
# x86-64 only (mooncc's native lane); off x86-64, or with no artifact built, the mooncc
# cells read dnf and gcc/clang are still raced.
#
# ⚠ THE net ROW IS A SUM OVER EVERY PHASE, so adding rows moves it and results either
# side of a row change do not compare. The per-row ratios do.
#
# usage: ./ccbench.sh [timeout-seconds] [samples]
#   build is timed once (a stable multi-second cost, and the artifact is reused);
#   test subtracts two medians of `samples` runs each (corpus, then empty boot), default 3.
# resolve the repo root ABSOLUTELY: the build lanes cd into it to reach the source
# globs (src/core/love.c, host/*.c, src/apps/...), so every output/include path below must be absolute.

# ⚠ THE COMPILER IS THE SHIPPED ARTIFACT, and it is not a preference -- it is the only

# src/apps/moon/lib/nolibc/ MEMBER BY NEED and caches the archive under ~/.love/cache/moon,

# that file's stat in the key, so while the lane ran out of out/mooncc -- whose
# .image this file's own make target rebuilt as a prerequisite -- every run missed and
# paid a one-time libc BUILD inside a per-build row: 43.8 s against 20.1 s warm, 54% of
# the number. A BAKED image keys as the word "<baked>" instead, so the entry survives
# every rebuild of the intermediates (measured then: `touch out/mooncc.image
# out/love` left it at 18.9 s). The one-binary change has since retired that image
# file, which closes the same hole from the other side -- but the artifact is still what
# this should race, because it is what a user runs. ⚠ a one-line C file does NOT warm the
# archive in its place: a program that needs no member pulls none.
