# ccsize.sh -- the SIZE half of the compiler differential, the table ccbench.sh's wall
# clock cannot answer: how much .text each lane lays, and how much of it is love's C
# rather than the libc underneath. Reads the binaries ccbench.sh leaves in out/bench/cc/
# (run it first), and writes two tables: the decomposition per lane, then mooncc against
# each native over the symbols both actually emit.
#
# The method, and every part of it is load-bearing:
#   * sizes are ADDRESS-GAP derived -- the distance to the next text symbol. Not
#     st_size, because mooncc's ELF does not carry it, and a comparison needs one
#     measure both sides answer. So every number here includes inter-fn padding (~1-2%).
#   * love's C is decided per lane by ITS OWN OBJECTS, never by the other binary. A
#     symbol the native binary lacks is NOT thereby mooncc runtime: gcc inlines 265 of
#     love's statics out of existence, and a set difference taken against the binary
#     reads every one of them as libc. That mistake put ~110 KB of love code in
#     mooncc's libc column for two fills of.
#   * names are canonicalized first -- gcc ships `c0_lambda.isra.0` where mooncc ships
#     `c0_lambda`, and the clone's bytes belong to the parent. 53 symbols (7.5 KB) land
#     in the wrong column without it.
#
# ⚠ this counts what a lane SHIPS, which for a libc is half the question: what it can
# CALL is the other half, and ccdead.l answers that one.
#
# usage: ./ccsize.sh          (after ./ccbench.sh, or `make ccbench`)
