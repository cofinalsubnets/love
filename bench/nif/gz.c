/* the GZIP floor -- src/core/gz.c, both directions, through mooncc, gcc and
 * clang, with the three reports diffed and the three builds timed. ccnif.sh
 * drives it.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE. this is the widest C in host/ and the least like the
 * rest of the tree: a 64-bit bit accumulator shifted by a runtime count, a
 * table indexed by a masked window, a greedy match finder walking a hash chain,
 * an insertion sort over packed keys, and an eight-in-order copy that is
 * DELIBERATELY not a word move. every one of those is a lane love.c never
 * exercises, and the file is compiled by mooncc in the shipped artifact.
 *
 * ⚠ A ROUND TRIP IS NOT ENOUGH and it is worth saying why. inflate(deflate(x))
 * == x holds under a great many wrong deflates -- any legal stream decodes --
 * so the compressed BYTES are reported too. deflate is a twin held to src/apps/gz/gz.l
 * at the byte (test/host/gzc.l), so its output is a fixed answer and not a
 * licensed choice: a differing byte is a differing compiler.
 *
 * ⚠ THE SUMMARY IS THIS FILE'S OWN ARITHMETIC. an FNV-1a over the output, not
 * the crc32 next door in src/host/hash.c -- a summary computed by the code under
 * test can agree with itself while both halves are wrong.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE MALFORMED STREAMS ARE PART OF THE SUBJECT, not a robustness check.
 * gz.c's inflate reproduces gz-puff's answer for a stream that does not
 * describe a code -- first-writer-wins in the table, a zeroed symbol array --
 * so what it answers on garbage is as specified as what it answers on a valid
 * block, and the refusal paths are where the bit reader's edges live. */
